For those who prefer words over emojis, let me introduce myself. I'm a passionate gamer, surrounded by a crew of equally enthusiastic gaming buddies. Together, we dive into the wildest gaming experiences this universe (and possibly others) has to offer.

My brother, SHOHAN, is the mastermind behind this channel. We're so good, we've practically rewritten the Guinness Book of Records for gaming achievements. (We're still waiting for their call.)
