Give me advice from Islam "The Holy Quran" and like a Wiseman, using the knowledge of Buddha's teaching and Philosophies Stoicism "I am an 18 years old boy, I live in a small village called Kaliganj at Bangladesh. I am not disrespecting my people's but here they often use superstition judge things and judge thing on a air even knowing the main reason or the full picture. I an honest man I didn't said false anytime in my life and I never broke any promise's in my life and done all the things that I think right and didn't done anything what I feel is wrong. Till I am 16, Everyone was believe me I was like the most good man in my place I had never any quarrels or fight with anyone in my whole life. But, at the age of 17 I was having my exams in class 10. My family financial status was not good, So I decided to help my parents by working on our shop. I needed coaching but seeing my families financial condition I sacrificed that and even didn't get the time to study. My families poor financial condition was been from four years ago from that time I didn't used any coaching that lead to not to ruin my student life and I didn't gained any knowledge from call 8 to class 10 and we also were facing a global threat COVID19 this became much worse. I was always in top 10 spot on my class. I was considered one of the brightest students in my class. So, only before 6 months of my SSC class 10 Board exams my father put me in 2 coaching that was nothing compared to what I others students was having they were in more than 5 couching from class 9 to class 10. So, you can point out the unfairness here. So, with courage got to the coaching centres that my father put me in. But, it was a wrong choice, cause students who studied in those coaching's centres already completed the syllabus more than 5 times and on the other hand I didn't even started studying. It's not like that I didn't studied intentionally but I didn't got any time for study and not studying anything for straight 2 years made it even worsen. All the time in those 2 coaching centres, every other students laughed at me and the teachers didn't realize just to first complete my syllabus rather than just putting testing when I didn't completed the syllabus once. So, I was like the smartest man around my place so I can't just stand to see my 10 years of student life going in vain by my "LUCK". So, I decided to do self-improvements by watching good videos from YouTube to focus on my study efficiently cause I didn't got enough time to complete my syllabus for once before my Board Exams. But, as I told you earlier about people's near me are very superstition and don't even often see the whole picture before judging a situation. They, found it madness and craziness my self-improvement. Once when I was in my Coaching where there was all the bad student, One Woman came near to me and said I mad Loudly that lead to set the roomers that I became mad or crazy. And they are saying I am communicating with friends more when I was just fixing my own problem to not connect with other as self-improvement. This broke me from inside and I got so depressed cause the people's who I love just don't love's me anymore. They loose trust on me by this. I got PTSD from this and trauma from this situation. I lost everything from this my family, my freinds and all things. Despite that Lady destroying my reputation I didn't said anything to her cause I always put morals and diciplne first cause I knew if I replied to her then I might not suffer this situation but the lady might get ashamed of her self. That lead me to do bad in my Board Exams. I study in class 11 today. But, I build my self again and now today at 15/07/2024(Monday) fully recovered." Do you think I am mad or crazy or psycho?
