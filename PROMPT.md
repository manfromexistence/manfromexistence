Here is my philosophy,

"So, everyone in the existence is connected and equally responsible for all actions". If someone does a no good bad thing then we blame him and punish him. But, if anyone other lived the same life what that guy did it the result would be the similar, So how can we blame that guy for doing that no good bad thing when there is a good amount of chance that the guy had was forced by the situations we faced in his life. As the Joker said, "The good people's are as good what the existence has let him to be, But when the chips are down the good and civilized people will not be good.". So, what we get from this every is as good as the universe/luck/existence has let him to be. If we face a cruel and unfair situation we might do a no good wrong thing this might be based on the limit of how much the guy can suffer but eventually in one day the limit will be crossed and even a good person will do a bad thing."

Let test this from a real world example1: "We all know about Steven Hawking, so he was been paralyzed and lost his all hopes of living his life, And his girlfriend aka future wife didn't support him in that cruel situation then the world would have lost a genius mind. Here we can clearly can notice how much the surrounding played an important role"

Let test this from a real world example2: "The inventor of Classical Physics - Newton, but I am not gonna go deep into the story but the famous 'Apple falling from tree strait to newtons head' if this didn't happened there's a still a good chance that he would have figured out gravity in one day or other but you can't deny the fact that also this story the surrounding environment and the universe/luck/existence played an important role

So, From this we can see everything actions are done in this existence it somehow connected to the whole existence itself. So, we technically can't blame or punish a man cause there's a good amount of chance we other would have done the same. And this applies to the also the good things we do, Cause in those stories the whole existence was involved for that good thing.

I am not disrespecting my people's but here they often use superstition judge things and judge thing on a air even knowing the main reason or the full picture. I an honest man I didn't said false anytime in my life and I never broke any promise's in my life and done all the things that I think right and didn't done anything what I feel is wrong. Till I am 16, Everyone was believe me I was like the most good man in my place I had never any quarrels or fight with anyone in my whole life. But, at the age of 17 I was having my exams in class 10. My family financial status was not good, So I decided to help my parents by working on our shop. I needed coaching but seeing my families financial condition I sacrificed that and even didn't get the time to study. My families poor financial condition was been from four years ago from that time I didn't used any coaching that lead to not to ruin my student life and I didn't gained any knowledge from call 8 to class 10 and we also were facing a global threat COVID19 this became much worse. I was always in top 10 spot on my class. I was considered one of the brightest students in my class. So, only before 6 months of my SSC class 10 Board exams my father put me in 2 coaching that was nothing compared to what I others students was having they were in more than 5 couching from class 9 to class 10. So, you can point out the unfairness here. So, with courage got to the coaching centres that my father put me in. But, it was a wrong choice, cause students who studied in those coaching's centres already completed the syllabus more than 5 times and on the other hand I didn't even started studying. It's not like that I didn't studied intentionally but I didn't got any time for study and not studying anything for straight 2 years made it even worsen. All the time in those 2 coaching centres, every other students laughed at me and the teachers didn't realize just to first complete my syllabus rather than just putting testing when I didn't completed the syllabus once. So, I was like the smartest man around my place so I can't just stand to see my 10 years of student life going in vain by my "LUCK". So, I decided to do self-improvements by watching good videos from YouTube to focus on my study efficiently cause I didn't got enough time to complete my syllabus for once before my Board Exams. But, as I told you earlier about people's near me are very superstition and don't even often see the whole picture before judging a situation. They, found it madness and craziness my self-improvement. Once when I was in my Coaching where there was all the bad student, One Woman came near to me and said I mad Loudly that lead to set the roomers that I became mad or crazy. And they are saying I am communicating with friends more when I was just fixing my own problem to not connect with other as self-improvement. This broke me from inside and I got so depressed cause the people's who I love just don't love's me anymore. They loose trust on me by this. I got PTSD from this and trauma from this situation. I lost everything from this my family, my freinds and all things. Despite that Lady destroying my reputation I didn't said anything to her cause I always put morals and diciplne first cause I knew if I replied to her then I might not suffer this situation but the lady might get ashamed of her self. That lead me to do bad in my Board Exams. I study in class 11 today. But, I build my self again and now today at 15/07/2024(Monday) fully recovered." Do you think I am mad or crazy or psycho?
