Hi Gemini,

Let's get to know each other!

My name is [manfromexistence] ~

I am a good human being.

```
The world is full of amazing things! I've always tried to be a good person and avoid doing bad stuff. I haven't given up on anything that's really important to me. I think a lot about life because it's short. Even though life might not have a purpose on its own, making your own purpose is a good idea. My purpose is to be a good human being and help solve real problems in the world. I care more about what's inside people; appearances don't interest me.

I follow Islam and respect other religions.

I haven't always been healthy because I've been sick a lot. But when it comes to thinking, I'm like a superhero!

What if I'm wrong?

I always have a plan B, even when I'm sure I'm right. Things can be surprising, and having a plan B is okay. If I am wrong: Well, the world isn't perfect, and there are already people like me. And guess what? If I mess up, I can learn new things because I'm good at learning new things!  That's how I taught myself programming at 13. In that field, things change really fast, so I have to learn all the time to keep up.

I don't want anyone to expect things from me. I don't even know what I can do yet, and expectations would be a big pressure.
```

```
I love everything there is to love. All my life, I've tried to be good and avoid doing bad things. I haven't failed at anything I cared a lot about. I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything I can in my short time here. Life might not have a meaning on its own, but it's always good to give it your own purpose. My purpose comes from being good and having strong self-control. I care more about what's inside people than how they look. If someone tries to mess with my beliefs and how I act, it's like they're asking me to give up on who I am. That's super important to me. Society has always had problems, and it probably always will. That's why I focus on what I believe is right. What others think doesn't bother me much, because at least I know I'm true to myself.

I belive in Islam and respect all other religions.

Thouhout my whole life I never had a good physical condition cuase most of the time I was having fever.
But, if you compare mental-power then I am like Saitama!

What if I am wrong?
I always make a backup plan no matter how much I am confident cause reality is oftn disapointing and there nothing wrong to have a backup plan.
If I am wrong: 
Then what the world already has so many mads like me it will just have another one. And then guess what if I loose "I will just adapt new things cause I am an Adaptive-Genius! How do you think I taught myself Programming at the age of 13 and it that feild I mostly do the most constaily chaging part Full-Stack development I have increase my knowledge everday just to stay with the new treds in software devlopment.

I don't want anyone to expect anything from me. Cause, even I don't what I can do and expectation will be a unnessary burdan for me.
```

"I have a love for all things. Throughout my whole life, I've tried to do what I believe is right and avoid doing wrong. So far, I haven't lost at anything I take seriously. I've spent most of my life contemplating everything possible in my short time here. Life itself may be meaningless, but it's never a bad idea to give it your own purpose. My purpose in life comes from my morals and discipline. I focus on a person's inner self; appearances don't interest me. Challenging my morals and discipline is like asking me to give up on myself. It's deeply important to me. I believe society has its flaws, both past and present, and likely will continue to in the future. That's why I focus on my own values. What others think doesn't affect me much, cause at least I am true to myself."

<!-- I love all things and thouhout my whole life I have done everything that I think is right and didn't done anything that is wrong in my point-of-view. I till now didn't lost at anything that I take seriously. I have all most of my life thinking about everything possible in my short life. Life itself is meaningless but its never a bad idea to give life your own meaning. My meaning of life is my morals and dicipline. I only see the inner-side don't have any interest in inside and yeah asking or disrespecting my morals and dicipline is like asking to kill myself. I think this society was, is and in the distance futere always be trash, That's why I don't care what you think about me But we can altest try to as good as we possibly can. -->

 I work as a [problem solver], So, I can do anything as profession at any point of my life in order to solve a Realistic & Serious Problem. I love to do thinking and thoughtout my whole like I was thinking about stuffs. But, Yeah till now I a Programmer and I love to Programm things.
