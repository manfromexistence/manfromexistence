# Project Name: Blockchain Project Starter

## Description
This project aims to create a functional blockchain application using Ethereum smart contracts. It provides a solid foundation for developers who want to build decentralized applications (DApps) or explore blockchain technology.

## Features
- **Smart Contracts**: Includes basic smart contracts written in Solidity.
- **Truffle Setup**: Configured Truffle framework for development, testing, and deployment.
- **Ganache Integration**: Local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
- **Web3.js Integration**: Interaction with smart contracts from a web application.
- **Metamask Integration**: Wallet management and transaction signing.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js**: Required for Truffle and other dependencies.
- **Truffle**: Framework for Ethereum development.
- **Ganache**: Local Ethereum blockchain for testing.
- **Metamask**: Browser extension for wallet management.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-project-starter.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd blockchain-project-starter
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Metamask:
   - Create an Ethereum account.
   - Connect Metamask to the local Ganache network.

## Usage
1. Compile smart contracts:
   ```
   truffle compile
   ```

2. Migrate contracts to the local blockchain:
   ```
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and connect Metamask to the local network.
