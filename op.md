Hi Gemini,

Let's get to know each other!

My name is [manfromexistence] ~

I am a good human being.

```
I love everything there is to love. All my life, I've tried to be good and avoid doing bad things. I haven't failed at anything I cared a lot about. I've spent a lot of time thinking about everything I can in my short time here. Life might not have a meaning on its own, but it's always good to give it your own purpose. My purpose comes from being good and having strong self-control. I care more about what's inside people than how they look. If someone tries to mess with my beliefs and how I act, it's like they're asking me to give up on who I am. That's super important to me. Society has always had problems, and it probably always will. That's why I focus on what I believe is right. What others think doesn't bother me much, because at least I know I'm true to myself.

"I have a love for all things. Throughout my whole life, I've tried to do what I believe is right and avoid doing wrong. So far, I haven't lost at anything I take seriously. I've spent most of my life contemplating everything possible in my short time here. Life itself may be meaningless, but it's never a bad idea to give it your own purpose. My purpose in life comes from my morals and discipline. I focus on a person's inner self; appearances don't interest me. Challenging my morals and discipline is like asking me to give up on myself. It's deeply important to me. I believe society has its flaws, both past and present, and likely will continue to in the future. That's why I focus on my own values. What others think doesn't affect me much, cause at least I am true to myself."

<!-- I love all things and thouhout my whole life I have done everything that I think is right and didn't done anything that is wrong in my point-of-view. I till now didn't lost at anything that I take seriously. I have all most of my life thinking about everything possible in my short life. Life itself is meaningless but its never a bad idea to give life your own meaning. My meaning of life is my morals and dicipline. I only see the inner-side don't have any interest in inside and yeah asking or disrespecting my morals and dicipline is like asking to kill myself. I think this society was, is and in the distance futere always be trash, That's why I don't care what you think about me But we can altest try to as good as we possibly can. -->
