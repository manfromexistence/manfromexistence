## Can I use Mantine with Vue/Svelte/Angular?

No, Mantine is a React library and does not support other frameworks/libraries.
Maintaining a library is a lot of work, Mantine is focused on providing the
best possible experience for React developers and does not plan to support
other frameworks in the future.

## What about Preact?

Mantine does not officially support Preact. However, several community members
reported that they were able to use Mantine with Preact without any issues.
