## Do you have a comparison with other libraries?

No, we don't provide a comparison with other libraries, because:

- Mantine changes rapidly â€“ new features and improvements are added constantly
- Other libraries change over time as well, so any comparison will be outdated soon
- Maintaining a fair comparison is hard, it requires deep knowledge of all libraries and their features

## How should I decide which library to use?

Go through the documentation and examples of each library, try to build something with them,
and decide which one fits your needs better.
Mantine, as well as other libraries, provides a lot of examples and documentation,
so you can make an informed decision based on that.
