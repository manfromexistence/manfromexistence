# Time Input

The `TimeInput` component consists of a label, and a group of segments representing each unit of a time (e.g. hours, minutes, and seconds). Each segment is individually focusable and editable by the user, by typing or using the arrow keys to increment and decrement the value. This approach allows values to be formatted and parsed correctly regardless of the locale or time format, and offers an easy and error-free way to edit times using the keyboard.

## Installation

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    cli: "nextui add date-input",
    npm: "npm install @nextui-org/date-input",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/date-input",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/date-input",
    bun: "bun add @nextui-org/date-input"
  }}
/>


## Import

<ImportTabs
  commands={{
    main: 'import {TimeInput} from "@nextui-org/react";',
    individual: 'import {TimeInput} from "@nextui-org/date-input";',
  }}
/>

## Usage

A `TimeInput` displays a placeholder by default. An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided to the TimeField using the defaultValue prop. Alternatively, a controlled value can be provided using the value prop.

Time values are provided using objects in the `@internationalized/date` package. This library handles correct international date and time manipulation across calendars, time zones, and other localization concerns.

`TimeInput` only supports selecting times, but values with date components are also accepted. By default, `TimeInput` will emit `Time` objects in the onChange event, but if a `CalendarDateTime` or `ZonedDateTime` object is passed as the `value` or `defaultValue`, values of that type will be emitted, changing only the time and preserving the date components.

### Required

`TimeInput` supports the `isRequired` prop to ensure the user enters a value, as well as minimum and maximum values, and custom client and server-side validation.

<CodeDemo title="Required" files={timeInputContent.required} />

### Disabled

The `isDisabled` boolean prop makes `TimeInput` disabled. Inputs cannot be focused or selected.

<CodeDemo title="Disabled" files={timeInputContent.disabled} />

### Read Only

The `isReadOnly` boolean prop makes `TimeInput`'s value immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, `TimeInput` remains focusable.

<CodeDemo title="Readonly" files={timeInputContent.readonly} />

### Without Label

`TimeInput` supports the `label` prop to show or not show the label.

<CodeDemo title="Without Label" files={timeInputContent.withoutLabel} />

### With Description

A description for the field. Provides a hint such as specific requirements for what to choose.

<CodeDemo title="With Description" files={timeInputContent.withDescription} />

### Label Placement

The label's overall position relative to the element it is labeling.

<CodeDemo title="Label Placement" files={timeInputContent.labelPlacement} />

### Start Content

If you want to display some content before the time inputs, you can set the `startContent` property.

<CodeDemo title="Start Content" files={timeInputContent.startContent} />

### End Content

If you want to display some content after the time inputs, you can set the `endContent` property.

<CodeDemo title="End Content" files={timeInputContent.endContent} />

### Controlled

An initial, uncontrolled value can be provided to the `TimeInput` using the `defaultValue` prop. A controlled value can be provided using the `value` prop.

<CodeDemo title="Controlled" files={timeInputContent.controlled} />

### Time Zones

`TimeInput` is time zone aware when a `ZonedDateTime` object is provided as the value. In this case, the time zone abbreviation is displayed, and time zone concerns such as daylight saving time are taken into account when the value is manipulated.

In most cases, your data will come from and be sent to a server as an [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) formatted string. [@internationalized/date](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/internationalized/date/) includes functions for parsing strings in multiple formats into ZonedDateTime objects. Which format you use will depend on what information you need to store.

- `parseZonedDateTime` – This function parses a date with an explicit time zone and optional UTC offset attached (e.g. `2021-11-07T00:45[America/Los_Angeles]` or `2021-11-07T00:45-07:00[America/Los_Angeles]`). This format preserves the maximum amount of information. If the exact local time and time zone that a user selected is important, use this format. Storing the time zone and offset that was selected rather than converting to UTC ensures that the local time is correct regardless of daylight saving rule changes (e.g. if a locale abolishes DST). Examples where this applies include calendar events, reminders, and other times that occur in a particular location.
- `parseAbsolute` – This function parses an absolute date and time that occurs at the same instant at all locations on Earth. It can be represented in UTC (e.g. `2021-11-07T07:45:00Z`), or stored with a particular offset (e.g. `2021-11-07T07:45:00-07:00`). A time zone identifier, e.g. America/Los_Angeles, must be passed, and the result will be converted into that time zone. Absolute times are the best way to represent events that occurred in the past, or future events where an exact time is needed, regardless of time zone.
- `parseAbsoluteToLocal` – This function parses an absolute date and time into the current user's local time zone. It is a shortcut for parseAbsolute, and accepts the same formats.

<CodeDemo title="Time Zones" files={timeInputContent.timezones} />

### Granularity

The `granularity` prop allows you to control the smallest unit that is displayed by TimeInput. By default, times are displayed with "minute" granularity. More granular time values can be displayed by setting the granularity prop to "second".

<CodeDemo title="Granularity" files={timeInputContent.granularity} />

### Min Time Value

The `minValue` prop allows you to validate time value before a certain time.

<CodeDemo title="Min Time Value" files={timeInputContent.minTimeValue} />

### Max Time Value

The `maxValue` prop allows you to validate time value before a certain time.

<CodeDemo title="Max Time Value" files={timeInputContent.maxTimeValue} />

### Placeholder Value

When no value is set, a placeholder is shown. The format of the placeholder is influenced by the `granularity` and `placeholderValue` props. placeholderValue also controls the default values of each segment when the user first interacts with them, e.g. using the up and down arrow keys. By default, the placeholderValue is midnight, but you can set it to a more appropriate value if needed.

<CodeDemo title="Placeholder Value" files={timeInputContent.placeholderValue} />

### Hide Time Zone

When a `ZonedDateTime` object is provided as the value to `TimeInput`, the time zone abbreviation is displayed by default. However, if this is displayed elsewhere or implicit based on the usecase, it can be hidden using the `hideTimeZone` option.

<CodeDemo title="Hide Time Zone" files={timeInputContent.hideTimeZone} />

### Hour Cycle

By default, `TimeInput` displays times in either 12 or 24 hour hour format depending on the user's locale. However, this can be overridden using the `hourCycle` prop if needed for a specific usecase. This example forces `TimeInput` to use 24-hour time, regardless of the locale.

<CodeDemo title="Hour Cycle" files={timeInputContent.hourCycle} />

## Accessibility

- Support for locale-specific formatting, number systems, hour cycles, and right-to-left layout.
- Times can optionally include a time zone. All modifications follow time zone rules such as daylight saving time.
- Each time unit is displayed as an individually focusable and editable segment, which allows users an easy way to edit times using the keyboard, in any format and locale.
- Time segments are editable using an easy to use numeric keypad, and all interactions are accessible using touch-based screen readers.
