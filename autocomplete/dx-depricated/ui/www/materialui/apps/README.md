# Pigment CSS apps

To test Pigment CSS demo apps, you can directly run -

`pnpm nx run @app/vite-app:preview` to start vite demo or `pnpm nx run @app/next-app:preview` to start nextjs demo after building automatically.

To start either of the apps in dev mode, just run -

`pnpm nx run @app/vite-app:dev` or `pnpm nx run @app/next-app:dev`
