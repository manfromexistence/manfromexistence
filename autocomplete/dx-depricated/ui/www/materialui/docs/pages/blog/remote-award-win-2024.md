## Reflections from MUI's leadership

Above all, this recognition as one of the best fully remote workplaces is a testament to the incredible dedication of our team.
A company's culture lives in the daily interactions of the people who work there.
I'm so proud to see ours celebrated for how, together, we've built a highly efficient remote work environment that's able to serve a global community comprising hundreds of thousands of designers and developers.

It's a reflection of the commitment shared by every MUIer, and proof of the power of remote teams united by shared principles and values.
Congratulations to all winners!
