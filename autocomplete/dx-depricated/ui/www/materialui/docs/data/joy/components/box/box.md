# Box

<p class="description">The Box component is a generic, theme-aware container with access to CSS utilities from MUI System.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Introduction

The Box component is a generic container for grouping other components.
It's a fundamental building block when working with Joy UI—you can think of it as a `<div>` with extra built-in features, like access to your app's theme and the [`sx` prop](/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/).

### Usage

The Box component differs from other containers available in Joy UI in that its usage is intended to be multipurpose and open-ended, just like a `<div>`.
Components like [Stack](/joy-ui/react-stack/) and [Sheet](/joy-ui/react-sheet/), by contrast, feature usage-specific props that make them ideal for certain use cases: Stack for one-dimensional layouts, and Sheet for surfaces that need access to Joy UI's global variants.

## Basics

```jsx
import Box from '@mui/joy/Box';
```

The Box component renders as a `<div>` by default, but you can swap in any other valid HTML tag or React component using the `component` prop.
The demo below replaces the `<div>` with a `<section>` element:

{{"demo": "BoxBasic.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true }}

## Customization

### With MUI System props

As a CSS utility component, the Box supports all [MUI System properties](/system/properties/).
You can use them as props directly on the component.

{{"demo": "BoxSystemProps.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true }}

### With the sx prop

Use the [`sx` prop](/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) to quickly customize any Box instance using a superset of CSS that has access to all the style functions and theme-aware properties exposed in the MUI System package.
The demo below shows how to apply colors from the theme using this prop:

{{"demo": "BoxSx.js", "defaultCodeOpen": true }}

## Anatomy

The Box component is composed of a single root `<div>` element:

```html
<div className="MuiBox-root">
  <!-- contents of the Box -->
</div>
```
