# Migrating to v6

<p class="description">This guide explains how and why to migrate from Material UI v5 to v6.</p>

## Start using the alpha release

In the `package.json` file, change the package version from `latest` to `next`.

```diff title="package.json"
-"@mui/material": "latest",
+"@mui/material": "next",
```

Using `next` ensures your project always uses the latest v6 alpha release.
Alternatively, you can also target and fix it to a specific version, for example, `6.0.0-alpha.0`.

## Breaking changes

Since v6 is a new major release, it contains some changes that affect the public API.
The steps you need to take to migrate from Material UI v5 to v6 are described below.
