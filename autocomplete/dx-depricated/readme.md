# Motivation
Dx has used many other opensource github repoes in it.This is not waste of time cause that repoes are fetced automaticlly by Terminalflow and this repoes is used probably in the best way possible by maintaing their copyrights after their repective owners.I used other repoes cause Dx aims to do a lot of things besides + up + down and every way around WWW INTERNET stuffts(not native cause that problem has its own solution guess the unique name would be,,,okay okay.. donot bottheer -> DX Native -I know such a uniqe name "I know I am best at naming stuffs" [And I am too lazy so donot expect me to put logo or link to that website here do it by yourself(Ninja Tecnic For Rankning Searh In Google Search --- and I beg you please go to Dx Native ignoring my bad joke)]).
And many things are already maded by cool programmers.I can make it but it will littery take me months doing so.Most imporatant thing is that I donot like to build the wheel again and again in this way nothing is going to be better cause we donot live
forever.But if you thing that this is unfair then look up to
inspirations
folder and delete your respective reposetry to gain access to your own products!!!
So, moral of this story no.. of this descritption.. I mean Novel stated above is --- OpenSource conrtibution is good for your health(Donot ask me how??)
and Dx is one of the most precious one amoung them!!!(LOL)

How to Steall || LOL Just kidding!!! || Anything made by me in exitence plus (any+every)thing in not exitstencev like doesnot exits like now But will exit... Later!!! like me yeah... yeah yeeah me BeingOfExistence is public and free to use anywhere!!! || Just put (BeingOfExistence => Pleaaases pretty pleasaase!!!) logo in that software or anddd...  in exitence plus (any+every)thing in not exitstencev like doesnot exits like now But will exit... Later!!!!!

### Tommorow is a mystery, Yesterday is history; we only live in Today and that's why it's called Present. So, here is your 10 presents:
| No. | Joke |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25! 🎃🎄 |
| 2 | Why do programmers prefer iOS development? Because on iOS, there are no Windows or Gates! 🍏🚫🪟 |
| 3 | Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs! 🐜🐞 |
| 4 | Why did the programmer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! 💸 |
| 5 | Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays (a raise)! 💼 |
| 6 | Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🌚🐜 |
| 7 | Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't Node how to Express himself! 😞📝 |
| 8 | Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! 💸 |
| 9 | Why did the programmer get kicked out of school? Because he kept breaking the class rules! 🏫🚫 |
| 10 | What is a programmer's favorite hangout place? The Foo Bar! 🍻 |

I hope these brought a smile to your face! 😊
