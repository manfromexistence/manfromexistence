# How to troubleshoot issues

Sometimes Ollama may not perform as expected. One of the best ways to figure out what happened is to take a look at the logs. Find the logs on **Mac** by running the command:

```shell
cat ~/.ollama/logs/server.log
```

On **Linux** systems with systemd, the logs can be found with this command:

```shell
journalctl -u ollama
```

When you run Ollama in a **container**, the logs go to stdout/stderr in the container:

```shell
docker logs <container-name>
```
(Use `docker ps` to find the container name)

If manually running `ollama serve` in a terminal, the logs will be on that terminal.

When you run Ollama on **Windows**, there are a few different locations.  You can view them in the explorer window by hitting `<cmd>+R` and type in:
- `explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Ollama` to view logs
- `explorer %LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Ollama` to browse the binaries (The installer adds this to your user PATH)
- `explorer %HOMEPATH%\.ollama` to browse where models and configuration is stored
- `explorer %TEMP%` where temporary executable files are stored in one or more `ollama*` directories

To enable additional debug logging to help troubleshoot problems, first **Quit the running app from the tray menu** then in a powershell terminal
```powershell
$env:OLLAMA_DEBUG="1"
& "ollama app.exe"
```

## LLM libraries

Ollama includes multiple LLM libraries compiled for different GPUs and CPU
vector features.  Ollama tries to pick the best one based on the capabilities of
your system.  If this autodetection has problems, or you run into other problems
(e.g. crashes in your GPU) you can workaround this by forcing a specific LLM
library.  `cpu_avx2` will perform the best, followed by `cpu_avx` an the slowest
but most compatible is `cpu`.  Rosetta emulation under MacOS will work with the
`cpu` library. 

In the server log, you will see a message that looks something like this (varies
from release to release):

```
Dynamic LLM libraries [rocm_v6 cpu cpu_avx cpu_avx2 cuda_v11 rocm_v5]
```

**Experimental LLM Library Override**

You can set OLLAMA_LLM_LIBRARY to any of the available LLM libraries to bypass
autodetection, so for example, if you have a CUDA card, but want to force the
CPU LLM library with AVX2 vector support, use:

```
OLLAMA_LLM_LIBRARY="cpu_avx2" ollama serve
```

You can see what features your CPU has with the following.  
```
cat /proc/cpuinfo| grep flags  | head -1
```

## Installing older or pre-release versions on Linux

If you run into problems on Linux and want to install an older version, or you'd
like to try out a pre-release before it's officially released, you can tell the
install script which version to install.

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | OLLAMA_VERSION="0.1.29" sh
```

## Linux tmp noexec 

If your system is configured with the "noexec" flag where Ollama stores its
temporary executable files, you can specify an alternate location by setting
OLLAMA_TMPDIR to a location writable by the user ollama runs as.  For example
OLLAMA_TMPDIR=/usr/share/ollama/
