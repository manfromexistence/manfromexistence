# FAQ

## How can I upgrade Ollama?

Ollama on macOS and Windows will automatically download updates. Click on the taskbar or menubar item and then click "Restart to update" to apply the update. Updates can also be installed by downloading the latest version [manually](https://ollama.com/download/).

On Linux, re-run the install script:

```
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

## How can I view the logs?

Review the [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md) docs for more about using logs.

## Is my GPU compatible with Ollama?

Please refer to the [GPU docs](./gpu.md).

## How can I specify the context window size?

By default, Ollama uses a context window size of 2048 tokens.

To change this when using `ollama run`, use `/set parameter`:

```
/set parameter num_ctx 4096
```

When using the API, specify the `num_ctx` parameter:

```
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama2",
  "prompt": "Why is the sky blue?",
  "options": {
    "num_ctx": 4096
  }
}'
```

## How do I configure Ollama server?

Ollama server can be configured with environment variables.

### Setting environment variables on Mac

If Ollama is run as a macOS application, environment variables should be set using `launchctl`:

1. For each environment variable, call `launchctl setenv`.

    ```bash
    launchctl setenv OLLAMA_HOST "0.0.0.0"
    ```

2. Restart Ollama application.

### Setting environment variables on Linux

If Ollama is run as a systemd service, environment variables should be set using `systemctl`:

1. Edit the systemd service by calling `systemctl edit ollama.service`. This will open an editor.

2. For each environment variable, add a line `Environment` under section `[Service]`:

    ```ini
    [Service]
    Environment="OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0"
    ```

3. Save and exit.

4. Reload `systemd` and restart Ollama:

   ```bash
   systemctl daemon-reload
   systemctl restart ollama
   ```

### Setting environment variables on Windows

On windows, Ollama inherits your user and system environment variables.

1. First Quit Ollama by clicking on it in the task bar

2. Edit system environment variables from the control panel

3. Edit or create New variable(s) for your user account for `OLLAMA_HOST`, `OLLAMA_MODELS`, etc.

4. Click OK/Apply to save 

5. Run `ollama` from a new terminal window 


## How can I expose Ollama on my network?

Ollama binds 127.0.0.1 port 11434 by default. Change the bind address with the `OLLAMA_HOST` environment variable.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## How can I use Ollama with a proxy server?

Ollama runs an HTTP server and can be exposed using a proxy server such as Nginx. To do so, configure the proxy to forward requests and optionally set required headers (if not exposing Ollama on the network). For example, with Nginx:

```
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;  # Replace with your domain or IP
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:11434;
        proxy_set_header Host localhost:11434;
    }
}
```

## How can I use Ollama with ngrok?

Ollama can be accessed using a range of tools for tunneling tools. For example with Ngrok:

```
ngrok http 11434 --host-header="localhost:11434"
```

## How can I use Ollama with Cloudflare Tunnel?

To use Ollama with Cloudflare Tunnel, use the `--url` and `--http-host-header` flags:

```
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:11434 --http-host-header="localhost:11434"
```

## How can I allow additional web origins to access Ollama?

Ollama allows cross-origin requests from `127.0.0.1` and `0.0.0.0` by default. Additional origins can be configured with `OLLAMA_ORIGINS`.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## Where are models stored?

- macOS: `~/.ollama/models`
- Linux: `/usr/share/ollama/.ollama/models`
- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\.ollama\models`

### How do I set them to a different location?

If a different directory needs to be used, set the environment variable `OLLAMA_MODELS` to the chosen directory.

Refer to the section [above](#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server) for how to set environment variables on your platform.

## Does Ollama send my prompts and answers back to ollama.com?

No. Ollama runs locally, and conversation data does not leave your machine.

## How can I use Ollama in Visual Studio Code?

There is already a large collection of plugins available for VSCode as well as other editors that leverage Ollama. See the list of [extensions & plugins](https://github.com/ollama/ollama#extensions--plugins) at the bottom of the main repository readme.

## How do I use Ollama behind a proxy?

Ollama is compatible with proxy servers if `HTTP_PROXY` or `HTTPS_PROXY` are configured. When using either variables, ensure it is set where `ollama serve` can access the values. When using `HTTPS_PROXY`, ensure the proxy certificate is installed as a system certificate. Refer to the section above for how to use environment variables on your platform.

### How do I use Ollama behind a proxy in Docker?

The Ollama Docker container image can be configured to use a proxy by passing `-e HTTPS_PROXY=https://proxy.example.com` when starting the container.

Alternatively, the Docker daemon can be configured to use a proxy. Instructions are available for Docker Desktop on [macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#proxies), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/windows/#proxies), and [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/linux/#proxies), and Docker [daemon with systemd](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/systemd/#httphttps-proxy).

Ensure the certificate is installed as a system certificate when using HTTPS. This may require a new Docker image when using a self-signed certificate.

```dockerfile
FROM ollama/ollama
COPY my-ca.pem /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/my-ca.crt
RUN update-ca-certificates
```

Build and run this image:

```shell
docker build -t ollama-with-ca .
docker run -d -e HTTPS_PROXY=https://my.proxy.example.com -p 11434:11434 ollama-with-ca
```

## How do I use Ollama with GPU acceleration in Docker?

The Ollama Docker container can be configured with GPU acceleration in Linux or Windows (with WSL2). This requires the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit). See [ollama/ollama](https://hub.docker.com/r/ollama/ollama) for more details.

GPU acceleration is not available for Docker Desktop in macOS due to the lack of GPU passthrough and emulation.

## Why is networking slow in WSL2 on Windows 10?

This can impact both installing Ollama, as well as downloading models.

Open `Control Panel > Networking and Internet > View network status and tasks` and click on `Change adapter settings` on the left panel. Find the `vEthernel (WSL)` adapter, right click and select `Properties`.
Click on `Configure` and open the `Advanced` tab. Search through each of the properties until you find `Large Send Offload Version 2 (IPv4)` and `Large Send Offload Version 2 (IPv6)`. *Disable* both of these
properties.

## How can I pre-load a model to get faster response times?

If you are using the API you can preload a model by sending the Ollama server an empty request. This works with both the `/api/generate` and `/api/chat` API endpoints.

To preload the mistral model using the generate endpoint, use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "mistral"}'
```

To use the chat completions endpoint, use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/chat -d '{"model": "mistral"}'
```

## How do I keep a model loaded in memory or make it unload immediately?

By default models are kept in memory for 5 minutes before being unloaded. This allows for quicker response times if you are making numerous requests to the LLM. You may, however, want to free up the memory before the 5 minutes have elapsed or keep the model loaded indefinitely. Use the `keep_alive` parameter with either the `/api/generate` and `/api/chat` API endpoints to control how long the model is left in memory.

The `keep_alive` parameter can be set to:
* a duration string (such as "10m" or "24h")
* a number in seconds (such as 3600)
* any negative number which will keep the model loaded in memory (e.g. -1 or "-1m")
* '0' which will unload the model immediately after generating a response

For example, to preload a model and leave it in memory use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "llama2", "keep_alive": -1}'
```

To unload the model and free up memory use:
```shell
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{"model": "llama2", "keep_alive": 0}'
```
