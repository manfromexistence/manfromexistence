Yes, it does. Let's start by defining the types for `Section` and `SectionizeResponse`. For the Section type, we would need `name`, `content`, and an optional `subSections` field (to store any potentially nested sections).

Here is the structure we can follow:

1. A `Section` struct which contains a `Name` for the section, `Content` of the section, and a slice of `Subsection` for possible subsections in that section.
2. A `SectionizeResponse` struct which contains a slice of `Section`.

In `server/types/` directory, create a new `section.go` file.

- server/types/section.go

```go
package types

type Section struct {
	Name       string
	Content    string
	Subsection []Section
}

type SectionizeResponse struct {
	Sections []Section
}
```

Once you have checked and confirmed this task, I will proceed to the next task which is creating a sectionize function in the server model.
