In the following implementation for error handling and conversation summarization in `server/model/proposal/create.go`, the changes will help anticipate any token limit errors. After collecting and formatting all the necessary context, we will check if the token number exceeds the permitted limit. If so, we will initialize a process for summarizing conversation pairs.

Changes will include:

- A check for the token limit before calling `CreateChatCompletionStream`
- A mechanism to iterate through conversation pairs for summarization
- Recursive calls of `CreateProposal` with summarized conversation, if necessary

-server/model/proposal/create.go:

```go
// Add this at the start of the CreateProposal function
const maxTokens = 8192  // The maximum tokens allowed by the model

...

// After preparation of the main conversation context, we add checks for tokens
tokenNumbers := GetTokenNumber(messages)  // Assuming you have a function for this

if tokenNumbers > maxTokens {

    // Iterate the Conversation pairs
    for i := 1; i < len(req.Conversation)-1; i++ {

        // Check if the assistant's part has been summarized before
        if req.Conversation[i].Role == openai.ChatMessageRoleAssistant && !req.Conversation[i].Summarized {
            // Summarize the conversation, assuming we have a function Summarize() returning summarized text
            summarizedContent := Summarize(req.Conversation[i].Content)
            req.Conversation[i].Content = summarizedContent
            req.Conversation[i].Summarized = true  // Mark the message as summarized
            break
        }
    }
    // Recursive call to CreateProposal after summarizing
    err := CreateProposal(req, onStream)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("Error recreating proposal: %s\n", err)
    }
}

...

// Proceed the rest of the function as usual
```

This block of code handles the error arising from exceeding the maximum tokens supported by the model. If the tokens exceeded are detected, we start the process of summarizing conversation pairs till we are within allowed token limits. This is implemented via a recursive call to `CreateProposal`.

Lastly, you should address the "superfluous response.WriteHeader call" error. This issue is usually due to an unnecessary double setting of headers in HTTP responses - HTTP headers should only be written once. The fix would involve a careful review of your HTTP response handling process ensuring that the response's headers aren't set after `WriteHeader()` has been called or body written into.

Please integrate these changes into your respective function to handle the errors as described. Additional iterations might be required to fine-tune and resolve adjacent issues arising from these changes. Please also ensure your token counting and text summarization functions are accurate and performant as they play a crucial role in this error handling process.
