# Using Plandex  🛠️

## New plan  🪄

```bash
cd your-project
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
plandex new
```

When you create a plan, Plandex will automatically name your plan after you give it a task, but you can also give it a name up front.

```bash
plandex new -n foo-adapters-component
```

If you don't give your plan a name up front, it will be named 'draft' until you give it a task. To keep things tidy, you can only have one active plan named 'draft'. If you create a new draft plan, any existing draft plan will be removed.

## Loading context  📄

After creating a plan, load any relevant files, directories, directory layouts, urls, or other data into the plan context.

```bash
plandex load component.ts action.ts reducer.ts
plandex load lib -r # loads lib and all its subdirectories
plandex load tests/**/*.ts # loads all .ts files in tests and its subdirectories
plandex load . --tree # loads the layout of the current directory and its subdirectories (file names only)
plandex load https://redux.js.org/usage/writing-tests # loads the text-only content of the url
npm test | plandex load # loads the output of `npm test`
plandex load -n 'add logging statements to all the code you generate.' # load a note into context
```

## Tasks  ⚡️

Now give the AI a task to do.

```bash
# with no arguments, vim or nano will open and you can type your task there
plandex tell 
# you can pass a task directly as a string 
# press enter for line breaks while inside the quotes
plandex tell 'build another component like this one that displays foo adapters in the table rather than bar adapters.
quote> use the same layout and styles, but update the column headers and formatting to match the new data.
quote> add the needed reducer and action as well. write tests for the new code.' 
# load a task from a file
plandex tell --file task.txt # or -f task.txt
```

## Changes  🏗️

Plandex will stream the response to your terminal and build up a set of changes along the way. It will continue as long as necessary and create or update as many files as needed to complete the task. You can stop it at any time if it starts going in the wrong direction or if feedback would be helpful.

You can review the changes that Plandex has built up so far in a user-friendly TUI changes viewer.

```bash
plandex changes
```

If you're happy with the changes, apply them to your files.

```bash
plandex apply
```

If you're in a git repo, Plandex will automatically add a commit with a nicely formatted message describing the changes. Any uncommitted changes that were present in your working directory beforehand will be unaffected.

## Rewind  ⏪  

If you want to rewind and try a different approach, you can use `log` to show a list of updates and `rewind` commands to go back in time.

```bash
plandex log # show a list of all updates to the plan, including prompts, replies, and builds
plandex rewind # go back a single step
plandex rewind 3 # go back 3 steps
plandex rewind a7c8d66 # rewind to a specific state
```

## Branches  🌱

If you want to try a different approach but also keep the current one around, you can use branches. Create a new branch before rewinding.

```bash
plandex checkout new-approach # create a new branch and switch to it
plandex rewind 2
plandex tell 'write the tests before the components.'
plandex branches # see all branches
plandex delete-branch new-approach # delete a branch
```

## Continue  ▶️

If a plan has stopped and you just want to continue where you left off, you can use the `continue` command.

```bash
plandex continue # continue the current plan
```

## Background tasks  🚞

If you want to run a command in the background, use the --bg flag.

```bash
plandex tell --bg 'now add another similar component for widget adapters'
```

To see plans that are currently running (or recently finished) and their current status, use the `ps` command. You can connect to a running plan's stream to check on it. Or you can stop it.

```bash
plandex ps # show active and recently finished plans
plandex connect # select an active plan to connect to
plandex stop # select an active plan to stop
```

## Context management  📑

You can see the plan's current context with the `ls` command. You can remove context with the `rm` command or clear it all with the `clear` command.

```bash
plandex ls # list all context in current plan
plandex rm component.ts # remove by name
plandex rm 2 # remove by number in the `plandex ls` list
plandex rm lib/**/*.js # remove by glob pattern
plandex rm lib # remove whole directory
plandex clear # remove all context
```

If files in context are modified outside of Plandex, you will be prompted to update them the next time you interact with the AI. You can also update them manually with the `update` command.

```bash
plandex update # update files in context
```

## Plans  🌟

When you have multiple plans, you can list them with the `plans` command, switch between them with the `cd` command, see the current plan with the `current` command, and delete plans with the `delete-plan` command. Archiving of plans will be added in the future for plans that you want to keep around but aren't currently working on.

```
plandex plans # list all plans
plandex cd # select from a list of plans
plandex cd some-other-plan # cd to a plan by name
plandex cd 2 # cd to a plan by number in the `plandex plans` list
plandex current # show the current plan
plandex delete-plan # select from a list of plans to delete
plandex delete-plan some-plan # delete a plan by name
plandex delete-plan 4 # delete a plan by number in the `plandex plans` list
```

## Conversation history  💬

You can see the full conversation history with the `convo` command.

```bash
plandex convo # show the full conversation history
```

## Conversation summaries  🤏

Every time the AI model replies, Plandex will summarize the conversation so far in the background and store the summary in case it's needed later. When the conversation size in tokens exceeds the model's limit, Plandex will automatically replace some number of older messages with the corresponding summary. It will summarize as many messages as necessary to keep the conversation size under the limit.

## Model settings  🧠

You can see the current AI models and model settings with the `models` command and change them with the `set-model` command.

```bash
plandex models # show the current AI models and model settings
plandex set-model # select from a list of models and settings
plandex set-model planner gpt-4 # set the main planner model to gpt-4
plandex set-model builder temperature 0.1 # set the builder model's temperature to 0.1
plandex set-model max-tokens 4000 # set the planner model overall token limit to 4000
plandex set-model max-convo-tokens 20000  # set how large the conversation can grow before Plandex starts using summaries
```

Model changes are versioned and can be rewound or applied to a branch just like any other change.

## .plandex directory  ⚙️

When you run `plandex new` for the first time in any directory, Plandex will create a `.plandex` directory there for light project-level config.  

If multiple people are using Plandex with the same project, you should either:

- Put `.plandex/` in `.gitignore` 
- **Commit** the `.plandex` directory and get everyone into the same **org** in Plandex (see next section).

## Orgs  👥

When creating a new org, you have the option of automatically granting access to anyone with an email address on your domain. If you choose not to do this, or you want to invite someone from outside your email domain, you can use `plandex invite`.

To join an org you've been invited to, use `plandex sign-in`.

To list users and pending invites, use `plandex users`.

To revoke an invite or remove a user, use `plandex revoke`.

Orgs will be the basis for plan sharing and collaboration in future releases. 

## Directories  📂

So far, we've assumed you're running `plandex new` to create plans in your project's root directory. While that is the most common use case, it can be useful to create plans in subdirectories of your project too. That's because context file paths in Plandex are specified relative to the directory where the plan was created. So if you're working on a plan for just one part of your project, you might want to create the plan in a subdirectory in order to shorten paths when loading context or referencing files in your prompts. This can also help with plan organization if you have a lot of plans.

When you run `plandex plans`, in addition to showing you plans in the current directory, Plandex will also show you plans in nearby parent directories or subdirectories. This helps you keep track of what plans you're working on and where they are in your project hierarchy. If you want to switch to a plan in a different directory, first `cd` into that directory, then run `plandex cd` to select the plan.

<!-- ```bash
cd your-project
plandex new -n root-project-plan # cwd is 'your-project'
plandex current # 'your-project' current plan is root-project-plan
plandex load file.go # loads 'your-project/file.go'
cd some-subdirectory # cwd is now 'some-subdirectory'
plandex new -n subdir-plan1 # current plan is subdir-plan1
plandex load subfile.go # loads 'some-subdirectory/subfile.go'
plandex new -n subdir-plan2 # current plan is now subdir-plan2
plandex plans # shows subdir-plan1 and subdir-plan2 in current directory + root-project-plan in parent directory
cd ../ # cwd is now 'your-project', current plan is root-project-plan
plandex plans # shows root-project-plan in current directory + subdir-plan1 and subdir-plan2 in child directory 'some-subdirectory'
cd some-subdirectory # cwd is now 'some-subdirectory', current plan is subdir-plan2
plandex cd subdir-plan1 # cwd is still 'some-subdirectory', current plan is now subdir-plan1
``` -->

One more thing to note on directories: you can load context from parent or sibling directories if needed by using `..` in your load paths.

```bash
plandex load ../file.go # loads file.go from parent directory
plandex load ../sibling-dir/test.go # loads test.go from sibling directory
```

## Ignoring files  🙈

Plandex respects `.gitignore` and won't load any files that you're ignoring. You can also add a `.plandexignore` file with ignore patterns to any directory.

## Help  ℹ️

There are a few more commands that haven't been covered in this guide. To see all available commands:

```
plandex help
```

For help on any command:

```
plandex [command] --help
```

## Aliases  🥷

You can use the `pdx` alias anywhere you would use `plandex`. Many commands have short aliases as well.

```bash
pdx l component.ts action.ts reducer.ts # plandex load
pdx t -f task.txt # plandex tell
pdx co # plandex checkout
pdx br # plandex branches
pdx rw # plandex rewind
pdx c # plandex continue
pdx ch # plandex changes
pdx ap # plandex apply
pdx conn # plandex connect
pdx s # plandex stop
pdx pl # plandex plans
pdx cu # plandex current
pdx dp # plandex delete-plan
pdx db # plandex delete-branch
```
