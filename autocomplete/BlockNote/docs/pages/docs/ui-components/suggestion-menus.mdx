# Suggestion Menus

Suggestion Menus appear when the user enters a trigger character, and text after the character is used to filter the menu items.

## Slash Menu

The Slash Menu is a Suggestion Menu that opens with the `/` character (or when clicking the `+` button in the [Block Side Menu](/docs/ui-components/side-menu).

### Changing Slash Menu Items

You can change the items in the Slash Menu. The demo below adds an item that inserts a new block, with "Hello World" in bold.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-slash-menu-items" />

Passing `slashMenu={false}` to `BlockNoteView` tells BlockNote not to show the default Slash Menu. Adding the `SuggestionMenuController` with `triggerCharacter={"/"}` and a custom `getItems` function tells BlockNote to show one with custom items instead.

`getItems` should return the items that need to be shown in the Slash Menu, based on a `query` entered by the user (anything the user types after the `triggerCharacter`).

### Replacing the Suggestion Menu Component

You can replace the React component used for the Suggestion Menu with your own, as you can see in the demo below.

<Example name="ui-components/suggestion-menus-slash-menu-component" />

Again, we add a `SuggestionMenuController` component with `triggerCharacter={"/"}` and set `slashMenu={false}` to replace the default Slash Menu.

Now, we also pass a component to its `suggestionMenuComponent` prop. The `suggestionMenuComponent` we pass is responsible for rendering the filtered items. The `SuggestionMenuController` controls its position and visibility (below the trigger character), and it also determines which items should be shown (using the optional `getItems` prop we've seen above).

## Creating additional Suggestion Menus

You can add additional Suggestion Menus to the editor, which can use any trigger character. The demo below adds an example Suggestion Menu for mentions, which opens with the `@` character.

<Example name="custom-schema/suggestion-menus-mentions" />

Changing the items in the new Suggestion Menu, or the component used to render it, is done the same way as for the [Slash Menu](/docs/ui-components/suggestion-menus#slash-menu). For more information about how the mentions elements work, see [Custom Inline Content](/docs/custom-schemas/custom-inline-content).
