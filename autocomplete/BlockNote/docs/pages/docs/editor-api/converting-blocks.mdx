# Markdown & HTML

It's possible to export or import Blocks to and from Markdown and HTML.

<Callout type={"warning"}>
    The functions to import/export to and from Markdown/HTML are considered "lossy"; some information might be dropped when you export Blocks to those formats.

    To serialize Blocks to a non-lossy format (for example, to store the contents of the editor in your backend), simply export the built-in Block format using `JSON.stringify(editor.document)`.

</Callout>

## Markdown

BlockNote can import / export Blocks to and from Markdown. Note that this is also considered "lossy", as not all structures can be entirely represented in Markdown.

### Converting Blocks to Markdown

`blocksToMarkdownLossy` converts `Block` objects to a Markdown string:

```typescript
blocksToMarkdownLossy(blocks?: Block[]): string;

// Usage
const markdownFromBlocks = editor.blocksToMarkdownLossy(blocks);
```

`blocks:` The blocks to convert. If not provided, the entire document (all top-level blocks) is used.

`returns:` The blocks, serialized as a Markdown string.

The output is simplified as Markdown does not support all features of BlockNote (e.g.: children of blocks which aren't list items are un-nested and certain styles are removed).

**Demo**

### Parsing Markdown to Blocks

Use `tryParseMarkdownToBlocks` to try parsing a Markdown string into `Block` objects:

```typescript
tryParseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown: string): Blocks[];

// Usage
const blocksFromMarkdown = editor.tryParseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown);
```

`returns:` The blocks parsed from the Markdown string.

Tries to create `Block` and `InlineContent` objects based on Markdown syntax, though not all symbols are recognized. If BlockNote doesn't recognize a symbol, it will parse it as text.

**Demo**

## HTML

The editor exposes functions to convert Blocks to and from HTML. Converting Blocks to HTML will lose some information such as the nesting of nodes in order to export a simple HTML structure.

### Converting Blocks to HTML

Use `blocksToHTMLLossy` to export `Block` objects to an HTML string:

```typescript
blocksToHTMLLossy(blocks?: Block[]): string;

// Usage
const HTMLFromBlocks = editor.blocksToHTMLLossy(blocks);
```

`blocks:` The blocks to convert. If not provided, the entire document (all top-level blocks) is used.

`returns:` The blocks, exported to an HTML string.

To better conform to HTML standards, children of blocks which aren't list items are un-nested in the output HTML.

**Demo**

<Example name="interoperability/converting-blocks-to-html" />

### Parsing HTML to Blocks

Use `tryParseHTMLToBlocks` to parse an HTML string to `Block` objects:

```typescript
tryParseHTMLToBlocks(html: string): Blocks[];

// Usage
const blocksFromHTML = editor.tryParseHTMLToBlocks(html);
```

`returns:` The blocks parsed from the HTML string.

Tries to create `Block` objects out of any HTML block-level elements, and `InlineContent` objects from any HTML inline elements, though not all HTML tags are recognized. If BlockNote doesn't recognize an element's tag, it will parse it as a paragraph or plain text.
