This integration guide shows you how to integrate **ZITADEL** into your Go API. It demonstrates how to secure your API using
OAuth 2 Token Introspection.

At the end of the guide you should have an API with a protected endpoint.

> This documentation references our HTTP example. There's also one for GRPC. Check them out on [GitHub](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/tree/authorization/example/api).

## Set up application and obtain keys

Before we begin developing our API, we need to perform a few configuration steps in the ZITADEL Console.
You'll need to provide some information about your app. We recommend creating a new app to start from scratch. Navigate to your Project, then add a new application at the top of the page.
Select the **API** application type and continue.

We recommend that you use JWT Profile for authenticating at the Introspection Endpoint.

Then create a new key with your desired expiration date. Be sure to download it, as you won't be able to retrieve it again.

## Prerequisites

This will handle the OAuth 2.0 introspection request including authentication using JWT with Private Key using our [OIDC client library](https://github.com/zitadel/oidc).
All that is required, is to create your API and download the private key file later called `Key JSON` for the service user.

## Go Setup

### Add Go SDK to your project

You need to add the [SDK](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go) into Go Modules by:

```bash
go get -u github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/v3
```

### Create example API

Create a new go file with the content below. This will create an API with three endpoints:
- `/api/healthz`: can be called by anyone and always returns `OK`
- `/api/tasks`: requires authorization and returns the available tasks
- `/api/add-task`: requires authorization with granted `admin` role and adds the task to the list

If authorization is required, the token must not be expired and the API has to be part of the audience (either client_id or project_id).

For tests we will use a Personal Access Token.

```go reference
https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel-go/blob/next/example/api/http/main.go
```

You will need to provide some values for the program to run:
- `domain`: Your ZITADEL instance domain, e.g. https://my-domain.zitadel.cloud
- `key`: The path to the downloaded key.json
- `port`: The port on which the API will be accessible, default it 8089

## Test API

After you have configured everything correctly, you can simply start the example by:

```bash
go run main.go --domain <your domain> --key <path>
```

This could look like:

```bash
go run main.go --domain my-domain.zitadel.cloud --key ./api.json
```

After you get a successful log:
```
2023/12/04 10:27:42 INFO server listening, press ctrl+c to stop addr=http://localhost:8089
```

### Public endpoint

Now you can call the API by browser or curl. Try the healthz endpoint first:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8089/api/healthz
```

it should return something like: 

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:29:38 GMT
Content-Length: 4

"OK"
```

### Task list

and the task list endpoint:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8089/api/tasks
```

it will return:

```
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:41:54 GMT
Content-Length: 44

unauthorized: authorization header is empty
```

Get a valid access_token for the API. You can either achieve this by getting an access token with the project_id in the audience
or use a PAT of a service account.

If you provide a valid Bearer Token:

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" http://localhost:8089/api/tasks
```

it will return an empty list:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:49:06 GMT
Content-Length: 2

{}
```

### Try to add a new task

Let's see what happens if you call the AddTask endpoint:

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" http://localhost:8089/api/add-task
```

it will complain about the missing `admin` role:
```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 09:52:00 GMT
Content-Length: 50

permission denied: missing required role: `admin`
```

### Add admin role

So let's create the role and grant it to the user. To do so, go to your project in ZITADEL Console
and create the role by selecting `Roles` in the navigation and then clicking on the `New Role` button.
Finally, create the role as shown below:

![Create project role in console](/img/go/api-project-role.png)

After you have created the role, let's grant it the user, who requested the tasks.
Click on `Authorization` in the navigation and create a new one by selecting the user and the `admin` role.
After successful creation, it should look like:

![Created authorization in console](/img/go/api-project-auth.png)

So you should now be able to add a new task:

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" http://localhost:8089/api/add-task --data "task=My new task"
```

which will report back the successful addition:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 10:06:29 GMT
Content-Length: 26

"task `My new task` added"
```

Let's now retrieve the task list again:

```bash
curl -i -H "Authorization: Bearer ${token}" http://localhost:8089/api/tasks
```

As you can see your new task ist listed. And since you're an `admin` now, you will always get an additional `create a new task on /api/add-task`:
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Mon, 04 Dec 2023 10:08:38 GMT
Content-Length: 62

{"tasks":["My new task","create a new task on /api/add-task"]}
```
