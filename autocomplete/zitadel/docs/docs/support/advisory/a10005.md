## Date and Version

Version: 2.39.0

Date: Calendar week 41/42 2023

## Description

Migrating to version >= 2.39 from < 2.39 will cause down time during setup starts and the new version is started.
This is caused by storage optimisations which replace the `eventstore.events` database table with the new `eventstore.events2` table.
All existing events are migrated during the execution of the `zitadel setup` command.
New events will be inserted into the new `eventstore.events2` table. The old table `evetstore.events` is renamed to `eventstore.events_old` and will be dropped in a future release of ZITADEL.

## Statement

This change is tracked in the following PR: [new eventstore framework](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/issues/5358).
As soon as the release version is published, we will include the version here.

## Mitigation

If you use this table for TRIGGERS or Change data capture please check the new table definition and change your code to use `eventstore.events2`.

## Impact

Once the setup step renamed the table. Old versions of ZITADEL are not able to read/write events.

:::note
If the upgrade fails make sure to rename `eventstore.events_old` to `eventstore.events`. This change enables older ZITADEL versions to work properly.
