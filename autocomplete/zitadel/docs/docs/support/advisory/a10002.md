title: Technical Advisory 10002
---

## Date and Version

Version: 2.40.0

Date: Calendar week 44

## Description

Since Angular Material v15 many of the UI components have been refactored
to be based on the official Material Design Components for Web (MDC).
These refactored components do not support dynamic styling, so in order to keep the library up-to-date,
the console UI will lose its dynamic theming capability.

## Statement

This design change is tracked in the following PR: [feat(console): MDC components](https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/pull/6482).
As soon as the release version is published, we will include the version here.

## Mitigation

If you need users to have your branding settings
(background-, button-, link and text coloring), you should implement your
own user facing UI yourself and not use ZITADELs console UI. Assets like your logo and icons will still be used.

## Impact

Once this update has been released and deployed, the console UI won't apply any coloring of your branding settings to the UI components.

:::note
ZITADEL hosted Login-UI is not affected by this change.
