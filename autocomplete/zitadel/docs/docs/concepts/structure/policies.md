Settings and policies are configurations of all the different parts of the instance or an organization. For all parts we have a suitable default in the instance.
The default configuration can be overridden for each organization, some policies are currently only available on the instance level. Learn more about our different policies [here](/guides/manage/console/default-settings.mdx).

API wise, settings are often called policies. You can read the proto and swagger definitions [here](../../apis/introduction.mdx).
