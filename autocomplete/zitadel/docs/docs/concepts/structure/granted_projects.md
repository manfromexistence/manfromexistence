# Granted Project

![Organization Grant](/img/concepts/objects/organization_grants.png)

With ZITADEL you can grant selected roles within your project to an organization. The receiving organization can then create authorizations for their users on their own (self-service).

An example could be a service provider that offers a SaaS solution that has different permissions for employees working in Sales and Accounting. As soon as a new client purchases the service, the provider could grant the roles ‘sales’ and ‘accounting’ to that organization, allowing them to self-manage how they want to allocate the roles to their users.

To learn more about how to setup Project grants, read this guide [here](../../guides/manage/console/projects#grant-a-project)
