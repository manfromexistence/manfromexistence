The idea of projects is to have a vessel for all components who are closely related to each other. Multiple projects can exist within an organization.

All applications within a project share the same roles, grants, and authorizations:

- **Applications** is your software that initiates the authorization flow. This could be a web app and a mobile app that share the same roles.
- **Roles** are a means of managing user access rights for a project.
- **Authorizations** define which users have which roles. Authorizations are also called “user grants”.
- **Granted Organizations** can manage selected roles for your project on their own.
