A ZITADEL custom domain refers to the ability for organizations to personalize the authentication experience by using their own domain name rather than the default ZITADEL domain.

This feature allows organizations to maintain their brand identity throughout the authentication process, providing a seamless and consistent user experience.
By configuring a custom domain within ZITADEL, organizations can replace the default authentication URLs with their own domain, such as "login.example.com" or "auth.companyname.com".

This not only enhances the overall user experience but also reinforces the organization's brand presence. Additionally, custom domains can contribute to trust and credibility, as users are more likely to recognize and trust URLs associated with the organization rather than generic domains. Overall, ZITADEL's custom domain feature empowers organizations to tailor the authentication process to align with their brand identity and user expectations.
