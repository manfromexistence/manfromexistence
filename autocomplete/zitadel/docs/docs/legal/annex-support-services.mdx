Jointly you and ZITADEL will be referred to as **the Parties**. The terms of service (**"TOS"**) outlined in this document establish the most important points of this Framework Agreement â€“ independently of the use of any other services.

Support Services agreements will automatically renew for additional one-year term upon submission of a purchase order for renewal, unless either you or ZITADEL provides written notice (E-Mail sufficient) of termination of any such term.
Each renewal will be at ZITADEL's then-current rate.
