## General

### Introduction

CAOS Ltd. (**"We"**, **ZITADEL**, **CAOS AG**, or simply **CAOS**), with head office in Lerchenfeldstrasse 3, 9014 St. Gallen, Switzerland, offers "Identity and Access Management as service" with the brand name "ZITADEL Cloud Services" and all of our Websites (**Services** or **ZITADEL Cloud**).

The customer relationship (**Framework Agreement** or **The Agreement**) is created by the **Customer** (**"you"**) by creating a user or organization within the ZITADEL Cloud Service or with signature of a purchase order between you and ZITADEL (jointly referred to as **Parties**).
On the basis of this Framework Agreement you may then choose to make use of payable services (**Subscription**) as you wish, i.e. you may book services, options and packages yourself at any time (**Booking**, **Purchase Order**, **PO**) and subsequently terminate them.

The terms of service (**"TOS"**) outlined in this document establish the most important points of this Framework Agreement â€“ independently of the use of any services.

This Agreement has the following appendices. When you enter the Agreement with us, you accept these agreements.

* [**Data Processing Agreement**](data-processing-agreement) - How we process personal data on behalf of you
* [**Service Descriptions**](./service-description/) - How we provide services to yo
* [**Policies**](./policies/) - Policies that apply for use of our services
* [**Enterprise Agreement**](./annex-support-services/) - Annex for Enterprise Agreement and Support Services

The outlined policies complement these terms of service.
When accepting the TOS, you accept these policies.

### Alterations

Any provisions which deviate from these TOS must be agreed in writing between the Customer and us. Such agreements shall take precedence over the TOS outlined in this document.

### Transfer

You may only transfer the Framework Agreement or Services used in the context of the Framework Agreement to third parties with our prior written consent.

## Our Services

### Type and scope of the services

We provide the Services under the conditions stated on our websites, or the latest customer specific purchase order, at the time of booking.

### Modifications of services offered

We are entitled to offer new services, to withdraw existing services (**Termination**) or to modify the specifications and prices of existing services (**Modification**) at any time.
If the modification or termination affects a service that you are using at that time, we will inform you via email that said service will be automatically modified and/or is no longer available after a period of 30 days.

If such modification would have a disadvantageous impact on the Customer use of service, ZITADEL and Customer must discuss the change with the Customer first and, to the best of its ability, find a solution that is acceptable to both Parties.
If such a solution cannot be found, ZITADEL may implement the modification and Customer may submit notice of termination of the relevant Service (email is sufficient) before the modification becomes effective without being obliged to pay contractual penalties or termination fees.
ZITADEL may modify the prices for a service after the minimum term of the agreement.

### Modification of services booked by you

You may change or terminate Services or Subscriptions booked by you at any time.
You may, where applicable, add more Services (e.g. add-ons) to your existing Services at any time.
Modifications will take effect in the next billing period, or as agreed otherwise between the Parties.
Changing services booked by you requires a new purchase order, stating the new conditions of the services after Modification, to be accepted by the Parties.

### Due care

We take all appropriate physical and electronic precautions to ensure the security and availability of our infrastructure and the service offered thereupon, in particular to protect against unauthorized access to data, data loss, failures and misuse.

The [Annex of the data processing agreement](data-processing-agreement#annex-regarding-security-measures) outlines the measures we take in more detail.
