title: APIs V3 (Preview)
---

import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

APIs (V3) organize access by resources (users, settings, etc.), unlike context-specific V1 APIs.
This simplifies finding the right API, especially for multi-organization resources.
V3 also offers more flexibility over the V2 API in these points:
- User schema definition for custom user management.
- Behavior customization (API call manipulation, webhooks).

**Note**: V3 is currently in [Preview](/support/software-release-cycles-support#preview) and not yet generally available (breaking changes possible). Check individual services for availability.
