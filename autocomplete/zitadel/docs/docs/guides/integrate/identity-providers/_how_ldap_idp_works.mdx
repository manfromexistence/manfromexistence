When you use an LDAP provider in ZITADEL, this is the login process:

1. ZITADEL tries to connect to the LDAP server with or without TLS depending on the configuration
2. If the connection fails, the next server in the list will be used to try again.
3. ZITADEL tries a bind with the BindDN and BindPassword to check if it's possible to proceed
4. ZITADEL does a SearchQuery to find the UserDN with the provided configuration of base, filters and objectClasses
5. ZITADEL tries a bind with the provided loginname and password
6. LDAP attributes get mapped to ZITADEL attributes as provided by the configuration
