## Overview

This guide will show you how to use ZITADEL to login users into your application (authentication).
It will guide you step-by-step through the basics and point out on how to customize process.

## OIDC / OAuth Flow

OAuth and therefore OIDC know three different application types:

- Web (Server-side web applications such as java, .net, ...)
- Native (native, mobile or desktop applications)
- User Agent (single page applications / SPA, generally JavaScript executed in the browser)

Depending on the app type you're trying to register, there are small differences.
But regardless of the app type we recommend using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE).

Please read the following guide about the [different-client-profiles](./oauth-recommended-flows#different-client-profiles) and why to use PKCE.

### Code Flow

For a basic understanding of OAuth and its flows, we'll briefly describe the most important flow: **Authorization Code**.

The following diagram demonstrates a basic authorization_code flow:

![Authorization Code Flow](/img/guides/auth_flow.png)

1. When an unauthenticated user visits your application,
2. you will create an authorization request to the authorization endpoint.
3. The Authorization Server (ZITADEL) will send an HTTP 302 to the user's browser, which will redirect them to the login UI.
4. The user will have to authenticate using the demanded auth mechanics.
5. Your application will be called on the registered callback path (redirect_uri) and be provided an authorization_code.
6. This authorization_code must then be sent together with you applications authentication (client_id + client_secret) to the token_endpoint
7. In exchange the Authorization Server (ZITADEL) will return an access_token and if requested a refresh_token and in the case of OIDC an id_token as well
8. The access_token can then be used to call a Resource Server (API). The token will be sent as Authorization Header.

This flow is the same when using PKCE or JWT with Private Key for authentication.

## Create Application

To create an application, open your project in Console and start by clicking on the "New" button in the Application section.

#### Application type

This will start a wizard asking you for an application name and a type.

<Tabs
    groupId="app-type"
    default="web"
    values={[
        {'label': 'Web Application', 'value': 'web'},
        {'label': 'Native Application', 'value': 'native'},
        {'label': 'Single Page Application', 'value': 'spa'},
    ]}
>
<TabItem value="web">

#### Authentication method

After selecting WEB, you'll next have to choose an authentication method. As mentioned before we recommend using PKCE.
For even better security you could switch to JWT or just rely on the standard Code Flow. For security reasons we don't
recommend using POST and will not cover it in this guide.

Please change the authentication method here as well, if you did so in the wizard, so we can better guide you through the process:

<AuthMethods selected="web" />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="native">

#### Authentication method

When selecting Native the authentication method always needs to be PKCE.

<AuthMethods selected="native" />
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="spa">

#### Authentication method

When selecting SPA the recommended authentication method is again PKCE. All common Frameworks like Angular, React, Vue.js and so on
are able to successfully authenticate with PKCE. Our management UI Console for instance uses PKCE as well.

<AuthMethods selected="spa" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
