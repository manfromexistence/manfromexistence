Sessions represent the state of a user session in ZITADEL. They can be aggregated and updated over time to reflect
the changes.

For example, a session could be started by checking a username and ZITADEL will return a new session
with some information about the user like their id and loginName as well as details about the session itself.
Later on, if the user's password was checked successfully, ZITADEL will update the session and provide the date and time
when the password was verified.

## Verification

Since sessions just represent the current state, it's the responsibility of the client to check whether that state is
sufficient. This also gives you some opportunities, e.g. if you have different requirements for different use cases.

Let's jump into the example from above and assume you have a simple login UI, which just requires the user to verify
their [username and password](./username-password#create-session-with-user-check).

If a user successfully authenticated using username and password, a session could look like:

```json
{
    "session": {
        "id": "218480890961985793",
        "creationDate": "2023-06-14T05:32:38.977954Z",
        "changeDate": "2023-06-14T05:42:11.631901Z",
        "sequence": "582",
        "factors": {
            "user": {
                "verifiedAt": "2023-06-14T05:32:38.972712Z",
                "id": "d654e6ba-70a3-48ef-a95d-37c8d8a7901a",
                "loginName": "minnie-mouse@fabi.zitadel.app",
                "displayName": "Minnie Mouse"
            },
            "password": {
                "verifiedAt": "2023-06-14T05:42:11.619484Z"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Your application would then need to check whether these `factors` are enough, esp. if the `verifiedAt` of both are within
an acceptable time range.

To get the current state of the session, you can call the [GetSession endpoint](/apis/resources/session_service/session-service-get-session),
resp. you can get several by [searching sessions](/apis/resources/session_service/session-service-list-sessions).

## Expiration

The session API allows you to expire sessions. Like previous with the factor's `verfifiedAt`, you can check the
`expirationDate` and decide if you want to accept the session or not.

```json
{
    "session": {
        "id": "218480890961985793",
        "creationDate": "2023-06-14T05:32:38.977954Z",
        "changeDate": "2023-06-14T05:42:11.631901Z",
        "sequence": "582",
        "factors": {
            "user": {
                "verifiedAt": "2023-06-14T05:32:38.972712Z",
                "id": "d654e6ba-70a3-48ef-a95d-37c8d8a7901a",
                "loginName": "minnie-mouse@fabi.zitadel.app",
                "displayName": "Minnie Mouse"
            },
            "password": {
                "verifiedAt": "2023-06-14T05:42:11.619484Z"
            }
        },
        "expirationDate": "2023-06-14T10:42:11.619484Z"
    }
}
```

You may have some cases where you even want to make sure the session does not expire within few seconds or other cases,
where you might use some information of an expired session like the user's `loginName` to automatically create a new
session in your Login UI and let the user only provide their password.

:::info
Note that ZITADEL will reject any expired sessions automatically and that they cannot be updated anymore.

### Set a lifetime

In order to expire a session, a `lifetime` duration can be set when creating or updating a session.
Note that each time a session is updated with a `lifetime` attribute set, the `expirationDate` will newly be calculated
from this point in time. This give you the opportunity to change the expiration, based on the successful `factors` of
the session.

```json
{
  "lifetime": "18000.000000000s"
}
```

:::info
Note that if the `lifetime` was not set, the session will never expire.

## Token Introspection

If you're relying on OAuth Token Introspection in your API, Session Tokens can't be used directly, since they
do not include all the necessary information for that. You'll need to exchange it first into an access token.
You can do so by guiding your user through the Login UI, where a session token will be required to finalize the
auth request. Check out the guide on [support for OIDC](./oidc-standard).
