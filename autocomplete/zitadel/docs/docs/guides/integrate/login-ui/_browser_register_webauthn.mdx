Now that you have started the registration within ZITADEL, you have to register the credentials in the browser.
This requires a call to the browser api and looks something like the following.
Make sure to send the public key credential creation options you got in the previous request from ZITADEL.

```bash
const credential = await navigator.credentials.create({
    publicKey: publicKeyCredentialCreationOptions
});
```
