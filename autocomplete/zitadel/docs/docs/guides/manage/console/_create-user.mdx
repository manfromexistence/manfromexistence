After a human user is created, by default, an initialization mail with a code is sent to the registered email. This code then has to be verified on first login.
If you want to omit this mail, you can check the **email verified** and **set initial password** toggle.
If no password is set initially, the initialization mail prompting the user to set his password is sent.

You can prompt the user to add a second factor method too by checking the **Force MFA** toggle in [Login behaviour settings](/docs/guides/manage/console/default-settings#login-behavior-and-access).

When logged in, a user can then manage the profile in the console, adding a profile picture, external IDPs and Passwordless authentication devices.
