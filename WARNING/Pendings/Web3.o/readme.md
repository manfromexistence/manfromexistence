## Get Started With Your Own Project

### A new project

Click the above "Open in Gitpod" button to start a new workspace. Once you're ready to push your first code changes, Gitpod will guide you to fork this project so you own it.

### An existing project

To get started with Laravel with MySQL on Gitpod, add a [`.gitpod.yml`](./.gitpod.yml) file which contains the configuration to improve the developer experience on Gitpod. To learn more, please see the [Getting Started](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/getting-started) documentation.

## Notes & caveats

* The template was generated using `curl -s "https://laravel.build/example-app" | bash` then moving the contents down to the root directory.
* [./gitpod.yml](./.gitpod.yml) updates `APP_URL` in the `.env` with the workspace address.
* [./gitpod.yml](./.gitpod.yml) launches the Laravel server bound to `0.0.0.0` so that the server is accessible in Gitpod.
