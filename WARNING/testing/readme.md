# Workshop Website for Scratch Visual Programming Language

## Project Overview

This project is developed by **MD MAHABUB HOSSAIN** for **Hareem Fatima** as a part of an Upwork contract. The main goal of this project is to create a workshop website where Hareem Fatima can teach students about the Scratch visual programming language.

## Scratch Visual Programming Language

Scratch is a block-based visual programming language targeted primarily at children. Users of the site can create online projects using a block-like interface. With Scratch, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations â€” and share your creations with others in the online community.

## Features

The website includes the following features:

1. **User Registration**: Allows students to register for the workshop.
2. **Course Content**: Provides a detailed curriculum of the Scratch programming language.
3. **Interactive Learning**: Includes interactive Scratch blocks for hands-on learning.
4. **Discussion Forum**: A platform for students to ask questions and discuss their learnings.
5. **Progress Tracker**: Tracks and displays the student's progress in the course.

## Technologies Used

The website is built using the following technologies:

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Installation

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/projectname.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd projectname`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
