In this project I am trying to build a platform to make developer experience (as dx is the shortform) better. By using this developers will manage huge website project more efficiently.It is a huge project so I have devided it in smaller component's like:

1. dx-authflow[having trouble to integrate authentication in your website? you need dx-authflow this thing got -: 536 social login options, all blockchain wallets supported in the world and 3 more awesome feature I just can't explain this project's features in this short description. I sure wasted so many time in this project. but the final results just make this hard work paid off 😊. I can promise you have never seen so much features in an authentication package!!! there is many things to say so just check the github repo -> https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-authflow.git (status:COMPLETED-@1.0.0)
]

2. dx-ai[by using this package you can use any ai models strait from huggingface,openai or any ai models providers to your own website ->  https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-ai.git (status:ALMOST_COMPLETED)]

3. dx-blockchain[will asemble all ethreum,solana and cosmos based blockchain in only place means you can intregate your website to any of this blockchain providers by using this package ->  https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-blockchain.git (status:ALMOST_COMPLETED)]

4. dx-frontend[will solve the headache of JavaScript frontend frameworks -> https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-frontend.git (status:FAR_FROM_COMPLETED)]

5. dx-backend[will give you a changce to use different backend backups for more sucurity of your users -> https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-backend.git (status:FAR_FROM_COMPLETED)]

6. dx-database[will assemble all 465 databases in the world and make your applications user's data more accessible in fast and efficient way ->  https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-database.git (status:FAR_FROM_COMPLETED)]

7. dx-ui[by using this one ui library you can use most popular ui libraries like material-ui,ant-design,nextui,chakra-ui... total 30+ libraries at once ->  https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-ui.git (status:ALMOST_COMPLETED)]

8. dx-ux[there are like millions of javascript libraries that are great but not no one is literally not even aware of. that's why I maded this project to assemble them all keeping in mind optimization website and provide an ai to search for the right libraries for right 👍 not the most popular ones ->  https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-ux.git (status:FAR_FROM_COMPLETED)]

9. dx-animeflow [this project will manage your website's icon - target to cover 5million icons in glassmorphisum,neon,rainbow,animated,sharp,fill,outlined and water-colored 💦 flavors,fonts,dom + window + canvas,animated svg and browser consoles and animations ->  https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-animeflow.git (status:FAR_FROM_COMPLETED)]

10. dx-paymentflow[ will provide you all payment dealing providers -> https://github.com/beingofexistence/dx-paymentflow.git (status:FAR_FROM_COMPLETED)]

# OpenSource Cloning / Stealling
Dx has used many other opensource github repoes in it.This is not waste of time cause that repoes are fetced automaticlly by Terminalflow and this repoes is used probably in the best way possible by maintaing their copyrights after their repective owners.I used other repoes cause Dx aims to do a lot of things besides + up + down and every way around WWW INTERNET stuffts(not native cause that problem has its own solution guess the unique name would be,,,okay okay.. donot bottheer -> DX Native -I know such a uniqe name "I know I am best at naming stuffs" [And I am too lazy so donot expect me to put logo or link to that website here do it by yourself(Ninja Tecnic For Rankning Searh In Google Search --- and I beg you please go to Dx Native ignoring my bad joke)]).
And many things are already maded by cool programmers.I can make it but it will littery take me months doing so.Most imporatant thing is that I donot like to build the wheel again and again in this way nothing is going to be better cause we donot live
forever.But if you thing that this is unfair then look up to
inspirations
folder and delete your respective reposetry to gain access to your own products!!!
So, moral of this story no.. of this descritption.. I mean Novel stated above is --- OpenSource conrtibution is good for your health(Donot ask me how??)
and Dx is one of the most precious one amoung them!!!(LOL)

How to Steall || LOL Just kidding!!! || Anything made by me in exitence plus (any+every)thing in not exitstencev like doesnot exits like now But will exit... Later!!! like me yeah... yeah yeeah me BeingOfExistence is public and free to use anywhere!!! || Just put (BeingOfExistence => Pleaaases pretty pleasaase!!!) logo in that software or anddd...  in exitence plus (any+every)thing in not exitstencev like doesnot exits like now But will exit... Later!!!!!

### Tommorow is a mystery, Yesterday is history; we only live in Today and that's why it's called Present. So, here is your 10 presents:
| No. | Joke |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Why do programmers always mix up Christmas and Halloween? Because Oct 31 == Dec 25! 🎃🎄 |
| 2 | Why do programmers prefer iOS development? Because on iOS, there are no Windows or Gates! 🍏🚫🪟 |
| 3 | Why don't programmers like nature? It has too many bugs! 🐜🐞 |
| 4 | Why did the programmer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! 💸 |
| 5 | Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays (a raise)! 💼 |
| 6 | Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs! 🌚🐜 |
| 7 | Why was the JavaScript developer sad? Because he didn't Node how to Express himself! 😞📝 |
| 8 | Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! 💸 |
| 9 | Why did the programmer get kicked out of school? Because he kept breaking the class rules! 🏫🚫 |
| 10 | What is a programmer's favorite hangout place? The Foo Bar! 🍻 |

I hope these brought a smile to your face! 😊
