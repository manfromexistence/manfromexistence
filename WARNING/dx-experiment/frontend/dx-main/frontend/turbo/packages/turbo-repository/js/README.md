## Repositories

Provides JS repository analysis functionality, scoped to the JS ecosystem.

Note that this is not yet a stable package, and functionality, API, and naming may all change.

## Development Notes

1.  The `.d.ts` file generated by NAPI is checked in, but not considered the definitive types to publish. We can give better details by adding our own edits on top of it. As a consequence, any PR that edits `index-generated.d.ts` will also need to edit `index.d.ts`.
2.  If new exports are added, `index.js` will need to be updated as well.
