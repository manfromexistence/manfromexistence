description: Our Support Policy for Turborepo and its ecosystem
---

## Operating Systems

`turbo` is generally supported on Debian-based Linux distributions, macOS, and
Windows on both x86_64 and ARM 64 architectures. Specifically, we build and ship
the following binaries via `npm`:

- turbo-darwin-64 (macOS with Intel chips)
- turbo-darwin-arm64 (macOS with Apple Silicon)
- turbo-linux-64
- turbo-linux-arm64
- turbo-windows-64
- turbo-windows-arm64

Darwin builds are intended for macOS on Intel and Apple Silicon. Linux builds
are tested on Ubuntu, but we expect them to work on most [Debian-based][3]
distros. Windows builds are tested on the [`windows-latest` runner][2] in GitHub
Actions.

### Unsupported Platforms

Running `turbo` on unsupported platforms is possible by compiling from source. Instructions
are available in the [contributing guide](https://github.com/vercel/turbo/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
The built source is a single binary, so instead of installing and invoking via your Node.js package
manager (e.g. `npm install turbo`), you will run the `turbo` binary directly:

```bash
/path/to/turbo run build
```

Since such invocations of `turbo` also defer to a locally installed `turbo` in your node_modules directory,
if you're attempting to run `turbo` on a JavaScript project with `turbo` in package.json dependencies,
use the `--skip-infer` flag to skip the deferal to the locally installed binary.

## Node.js Compatibility

Most core `turbo` functionality (especially `turbo run`) does not depend on the
active Node.js version on your system, but some features of Turborepo and its ecosystem
such as `create-turbo`, `turbo-ignore`, and `eslint-plugin-turbo` do. For these features,
we intend to support the [Active and Maintenance LTS versions of Node.js][1].

All of our [examples](/repo/docs/getting-started/from-example) are also expected to
work with these versions.

## Package Managers

Core `turbo` functionality depends on the package managers in the JS ecosystem
and their implementations of workspace configuration (in monorepos) and
lockfiles formats. We intend to support:

- `npm` (v6+)
- `yarn` (v1+) (v4 partially supported)
- `pnpm` (v6+)
- `bun` (v1+) (beta, doesn't support all features)

It should be noted that package managers themselves have their own release
schedules, bugs, and features. While we intend to keep up with new major
versions, we may not release support immediately.

## Version Control

We support repositories that are version controlled with `.git` and repositories that don't have
version control at all. Any other version control system will be ignored. Note that we use `git`
to hash files, so repositories without git may perform and behave differently.

## Releases

Turborepo "loosely" follows SemVer policy. This means that we generally do not
expect to make intentional "breaking" changes in patch or minor versions.

Some exceptions to this may be:

- Configuration changes in `turbo.json`.

  These should usually be accompanied by a codemod that you can run with
  `npx @turbo/codemod update` and with at least one minor release that includes a
  deprecation message.

- Intentional behavioral changes to `turbo`'s CLI commands.

  These should land in minor releases. If the change is large or disruptive enough, we may
  include flags to opt into the previous behavior.
