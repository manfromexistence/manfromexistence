# Continuous Integration

Turborepo not only speeds up builds, but also the rest of your Continuous Integration pipeline by using [Remote Caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching). Below are a few platform recipes to use Turborepo with your CI providers.

- [Vercel](/repo/docs/ci/vercel) (zero configuration required)
- [CircleCI](/repo/docs/ci/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](/repo/docs/ci/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](/repo/docs/ci/gitlabci)
- [Travis CI](/repo/docs/ci/travisci)

## Setup

To enable Remote Caching for your CI:

1. Setup the environment variables for Turborepo to access your Remote Cache.
   | Variable | Description |
   | ----------- | ----------- |
   | `TURBO_TOKEN` | The Bearer token to access the Remote Cache |
   | `TURBO_TEAM` | The account name associated with your repository |

2. Clone your repository.
3. Install your dependencies through your package manager.
4. Run your tasks through `turbo`.
