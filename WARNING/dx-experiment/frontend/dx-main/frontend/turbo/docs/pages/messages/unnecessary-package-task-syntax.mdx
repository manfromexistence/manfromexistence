# Unnecessary package task syntax

## Why This Error Occurred

Turborepo supports adding additional `turbo.json` files in a package directory
to override the `turbo.json` file declared at the repository root, a feature called [Workspace Configurations](/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/configuring-workspaces).
In those additional `turbo.json` files, you can only configure tasks for that specific
package. Therefore, only the task name should be included in the pipeline,
not the package and task name (`package#task`).

`turbo.json` file in `apps/web` directory:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "web#build": {
      "dependsOn": ["lint"]
    }
  }
}
```

Since this `turbo.json` file is inside a package directory, the `web` prefix is unnecessary.

## Solution

Remove the package prefix from the task name:

```json
{
  "pipeline": {
    "build": {
      "dependsOn": ["lint"]
    }
  }
}
```
