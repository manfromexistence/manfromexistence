# CLI Reference

You can use `turbo --help` to get information on how to use these command and get additional
information about their usage on these pages:

- [`run`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/run)
- [`prune`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/prune)
- [`gen`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/gen)
- [`login`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/login)
- [`logout`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/logout)
- [`link`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/link)
- [`unlink`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/unlink)
- [`bin`](/repo/docs/reference/command-line-reference/bin)

## Option Syntax

Options can be passed to `turbo` in different ways. Options that require a value can be passed with an equals sign:

```sh
--opt=<value>
--opt="<value with a space>"
```

They can also be passed with a space between:

```sh
--opt value
--opt "value with a space"
```

Boolean options can be enabled as follows:

```sh
# To pass true
--opt

# To pass false
--opt=false
```

## Global Arguments

The following flags apply to all commands.

#### `--color`

Forces the use of color even when the output stream is not considered to be a TTY terminal.
This can be used to enable `turbo`'s color output for CI runners such as Github Actions which
have support for rendering color in their log output.

```sh
turbo run build --color
```

Alternatively, you can also enable color using the `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable (borrowed
from the [supports-color nodejs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supports-color)). Note that
this may also enable additional colored output from the actual tasks themselves if
they use `supports-color` to determine whether or not to output with colored output.

```sh
declare -x FORCE_COLOR=1
turbo run build
```

#### `--no-color`

Suppresses the use of color in the output when running `turbo` in an interactive / TTY session.

```sh
turbo run build --no-color
```

Alternatively, you can also suppress color using the `FORCE_COLOR` environment variable (borrowed
from the [supports-color nodejs package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supports-color)).

```sh
declare -x FORCE_COLOR=0
turbo run build
```

#### `--no-update-notifier`

Disables the update notification. This notification will be automatically disabled when running in CI environments, but can also be disabled manually via this flag.

```sh
turbo run build --no-update-notifier
```

Alternatively, you can also disable the update notification by using either the `TURBO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` environment variable, or the `NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER` environment variable (borrowed from the [update-notifier nodejs package](https://github.com/yeoman/update-notifier)).

```sh
declare -x TURBO_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1
turbo run build
```
