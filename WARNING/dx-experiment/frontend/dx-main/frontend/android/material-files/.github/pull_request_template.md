First of all, thank you for your interest in help improving this project! However, I normally won't accept PRs for this project because I'm currently the only copyright owner for it (except for translations and maybe my company), which I think would be a nice thing to keep along. On the other hand, forcing people to give up their copyright to me is both awkward and legally-complex. So if you have any suggestions for an improvement, please feel free to comment on existing issues or open a new one!
