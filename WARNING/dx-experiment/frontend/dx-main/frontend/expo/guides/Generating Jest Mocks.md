# Generating new Jest Mocks

This document will guide you through the process of generating new Jest Mocks for `packages/jest-expo` module using `apps/jest-expo-mock-generator`.

# **Why**

We provide some mocks of our native methods which are generated by traversing all the modules and its methods and making a configuration of all those methods with the number of arguments etc.

# **How**

1. In your terminal, go to `apps/jest-expo-mock-generator`
  - run `yarn` to ensure the dependencies are installed
  - run `expo start` to start the Expo server

2. Open the **Expo Go** project on `iOS` by opening `ios/Exponent.xcworkspace`
  - run the project on a simulator or a device

3. Open `jest-expo-mock-generator` in the running **Expo Go** app

4. After the app is finished opening, in the terminal, where the Expo server is running, you should see a big chunk of text wrapped with

    `------------------------------COPY THE TEXT BELOW------------------------------`

    and

    `------------------------------END OF TEXT TO COPY------------------------------`

    lines. Select and copy the text from between those lines.

5. Stop the Expo server running in `apps/jest-expo-mock-generator`, started in step 1.

6. Paste the copied text into `packages/jest-expo/src/preset/expoModules.js`.

7. In the terminal, go into `packages/jest-expo`.

8. Run `yarn prettier src/preset/expoModules.js --write`.

9. Commit the changes. Bonus points for not modifying mock values (like `deviceYearClass`), which will be different if you use a test device different than the one used before.
