We welcome contributions for bug fixes and are more conservative about changing the selected set of rules. The way ESLint is structured, you also can layer new rules on top of a config if you wish to customize your lint rules a little differently.

### Tests

Include a test plan with your pull request and add new tests if needed. Run `yarn test` to run the test suite and help keep this package stable.

Also run `yarn lint` to run this linter configuration on itself. This keeps the code consistently formatted and tests the linter, too.
