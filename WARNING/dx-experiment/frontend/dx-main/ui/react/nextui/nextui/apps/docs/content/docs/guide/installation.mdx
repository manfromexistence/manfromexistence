To use NextUI in your project, you need to follow the following steps:

## Global Installation

The easiest way to get started with NextUI is to use the global installation. Which means
that all the components are imported from a single package.

Follow the steps below to install all NextUI components:

<Steps>

### Install Packages

To install NextUI, run one of the following commands in your terminal:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm i @nextui-org/react framer-motion",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/react framer-motion",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/react framer-motion",
  }}
/>

### Tailwind CSS Setup

NextUI is built on top of Tailwind CSS, so you need to install Tailwind CSS first. You can follow the official
[installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) to install Tailwind CSS. Then you need to add
the following code to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js {8,13-14}
// tailwind.config.js
const {nextui} = require("@nextui-org/react");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // ...
    "./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [nextui()],
};
```

### Provider Setup

It is essential to add the `NextUIProvider` at the `root` of your application.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

// 1. import `NextUIProvider` component
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/react";

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap NextUIProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <YourApplication />
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}
```

### Setup pnpm (optional)

If you are using pnpm, you need to add the following code to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@nextui-org/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.

</Steps>

## Individual Installation

NextUI is also available as individual packages. You can install each package separately. This
is useful if you want to reduce the size of your CSS bundle as it will only include styles for the components
you're actually using.

> **Note**: JavaScript bundle size will not change due to tree shaking support in NextUI.

Follow the steps below to install each package separately:

<Steps>

### Install Core Packages

Although you can install each package separately, you need to install the core packages first
to ensure that all components work correctly.

Run one of the following commands in your terminal to install the core packages:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm i @nextui-org/theme @nextui-org/system framer-motion",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/theme @nextui-org/system framer-motion",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/theme @nextui-org/system framer-motion",
  }}
/>{" "}

### Install Component

Now, let's install the component you want to use. For example, if you want to use the
[Button](/docs/components/button) component, you need to run one of the following commands
in your terminal:

<PackageManagers
  commands={{
    npm: "npm i @nextui-org/button",
    yarn: "yarn add @nextui-org/button",
    pnpm: "pnpm add @nextui-org/button",
  }}
/>

### Tailwind CSS Setup

TailwindCSS setup changes a bit when you use individual packages. You only need to add the
styles of the components your using to your `tailwind.config.js` file. For example, for the
[Button](/docs/components/button) component, you need to add the following code to your
`tailwind.config.js` file:

```js {8,10,16}
// tailwind.config.js
const {nextui} = require("@nextui-org/theme");

/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    // single component styles
    "./node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/components/button.js", 
    // or you can use a glob pattern (multiple component styles)
    './node_modules/@nextui-org/theme/dist/components/(button|snippet|code|input).js'
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  darkMode: "class",
  plugins: [nextui()],
};
```

### Provider Setup

It is essential to add the `NextUIProvider` at the `root` of your application.

```jsx
import * as React from "react";

// 1. import `NextUIProvider` component
import {NextUIProvider} from "@nextui-org/system";

function App() {
  // 2. Wrap NextUIProvider at the root of your app
  return (
    <NextUIProvider>
      <YourApplication />
    </NextUIProvider>
  );
}
```

### Use the Component

Now, you can use the component you installed in your application:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import {Button} from "@nextui-org/button";

function App() {
  return (
    <Button>Press me</Button>
  );
}
```


### Setup pnpm (optional)

If you are using pnpm, you need to add the following code to your `.npmrc` file:

```bash
public-hoist-pattern[]=*@nextui-org/*
```

After modifying the `.npmrc` file, you need to run `pnpm install` again to ensure that the dependencies are installed correctly.
