We are thrilled to announce the latest update to NextUI, version **2.1.0**! This release introduces some game-changing
additions that many of you have eagerly been waiting for.

First on the list is the highly-anticipated **Select** component. Fully customizable and beautifully designed, supports both single and
multi-select modes and is accessible out of the box.

But that's not all. We're also rolling out two more incredible components **Listbox** and **ScrollShadow**. The new
**Listbox** allows you to make list manipulations more efficient and visually appealing. Meanwhile, the
**ScrollShadow** component adds an elegant shadow effect to scrollable areas, enhancing the UI aesthetics while
also improving usability.

## Select

Creating a select component that is both accessible and customizable is a challenging task. We've spent a lot of time
researching and testing different approaches to come up with a solution that works for everyone. The result is a
component that is easy to use, fully accessible, and highly customizable.

The new **Select** component includes:

- Support for selecting a single option.
- Support for selecting multiple options.
- Support for disabled options.
- Support for sections.
- Labeling support for accessibility.
- Exposed to assistive technology as a button with a listbox popup using ARIA (combined with [Listbox](/docs/components/listbox)).
- Support for description and error message help text linked to the input via ARIA.
- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions.
- Tab stop focus management.
- Asynchronous options loading.
- Keyboard support for opening the listbox using the arrow keys, including automatically focusing the first or last item accordingly.
- Typeahead to allow selecting options by typing text, even without opening the listbox.
- Browser autofill integration via a hidden native `<select>` element.
- Support for mobile form navigation via software keyboard.
- Mobile screen reader listbox dismissal support.
- And much more...

### Single Select

The single select component is used to select a single option from a list of options. It is a combination of a button
and a listbox. The button displays the currently selected option and the listbox displays the available options.

### Multiple Select

The multiple select component can be used to select multiple options from a list of options.

You only need to pass the `selectionMode="multiple"` prop to the `Select` component.

<CodeDemo title="Multiple Selection" files={selectContent.multiple} />

### Multiple Variants

The select component comes with multiple variants.

<CodeDemo title="Variants" files={selectContent.variants} />


### Chips Support

The select component is flexible and allows you to render any component as an option and as a selected option.

<CodeDemo title="Multiple Selection with Chips" files={selectContent.multipleWithChips} />


### Customizable

The select component is highly customizable, you can customize the selected option, the options, the listbox,
the popover and the scrollable area.

## Listbox

The listbox component allows you to make list manipulations more efficient and visually appealing.

The new **Listbox** component includes:

- Support for single, multiple, or no selection.
- Exposed to assistive technology as a `listbox` using ARIA.
- Support for disabled items.
- Support for sections.
- Labeling support for accessibility.
- Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions.

> **Note**: In the above example, we've utilized the [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) icons collection.

Go to the [Listbox](/docs/components/listbox) component page to learn more about it.


## ScrollShadow

The ScrollShadow component gives a nice shadow effect to scrollable areas. These shadows are handled by using
the CSS `mask-image` property, which makes the shadows adapt to the background color.

### Usage

<CodeDemo title="Usage" files={scrollShadowContent.usage} />

You can hide the scrollbars, customize the shadows size, change the orientation, and more.

Go to the [ScrollShadow](/docs/components/scroll-shadow) component page to learn more about it.
