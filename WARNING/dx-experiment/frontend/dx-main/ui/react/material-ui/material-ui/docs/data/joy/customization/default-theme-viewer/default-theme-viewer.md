# Default theme viewer

<p class="description">This tree view allows you to explore how the theme object looks like with the default values.</p>

To create your own theme, start by customizing the [theme colors](/joy-ui/customization/theme-colors/).

You can play with the documentation theme object in your browser console,
as the `theme` variable is exposed on all the documentation pages.

:::warning
This is a work in progress. JoyÂ UI's default theme isn't finalized yet.
<br />
<br />
Please note that **the documentation site is using a custom theme** (the MUI's organization branding).
