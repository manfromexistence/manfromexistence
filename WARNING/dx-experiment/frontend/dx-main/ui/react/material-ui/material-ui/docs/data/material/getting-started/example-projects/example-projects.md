# Example projects

<p class="description">A collection of examples, boilerplates, and scaffolds to jumpstart your next Material UI project.</p>

## Official examples

The following starter projects are all available in the [`/examples`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples) folder of the Material UI GitHub repository.
These examples feature Material UI paired with other popular React libraries and frameworks, so you can skip the initial setup steps and jump straight into building.

Not sure which to pick?
We recommend Next.js for server-side rendering, or Vite if you're looking to build a SPA.
See [Start a New React Project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) from the official React docs to learn more about the options available.

## Official themes and templates

Once you've chosen your preferred scaffold above, you could move on to the [Templates](/material-ui/getting-started/templates/) doc and choose a readymade user interface to plug in.

For more complex prebuilt UIs, check out our [premium themes and templates](https://mui.com/store/?utm_source=docs&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=example-projects-store) in the MUI Store.

## Community projects
