# Bundle fixtures

A collection of "smoke"-test that verify that the package layout is correct.

`createFixture` is used to create new or update existing fixtures.
The created file might need some manual adjustment since not every edge case is covered.

## Run a fixture

1. Navigate into the fixture you want to test (where the `package.json` is located)
1. Use the node version you want to use (e.g. `nvm use 14.0.0`)
1. Prepare the package.json
   - to test a Pull Request
     1. checkout branch
     1. `pnpm`
     1. `pnpm lerna run build --scope "@mui/*"`
     1. `cd` to fixture
     1. `pnpm install`
     1. `node ../../scripts/useBuildFromSource.js .`
   - to test a published npm dist tag (e.g. `latest` or `next`) on npm
     1. `cd` to fixture
     1. adjust the dependencies in the package.json accordingly
     1. `pnpm install`
1. `pnpm start` should exit with 0

### In CI

You have to run our CircleCI pipeline with the `workflow` parameter set to `bundling`.

With the following API request we're triggering a run of the bundling workflow in
PR #24289:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://circleci.com/api/v2/project/gh/mui/material-ui/pipeline \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --header 'Circle-Token: $CIRCLE_TOKEN' \
  --data-raw '{"branch":"pull/24289/head","parameters":{"workflow":"bundling"}}'
```

`$CIRCLE_TOKEN` must be set as an environment variable created from https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens.

## Add a new fixture

1. Create a folder in `test/fixtures/bundling`
1. Add the necessary dependencies
1. Re-use the entries for `dependencies` and `resolutions` for `@mui/*` packages from the other fixtures
1. Create a template
1. Write a factory that fills the template in `test/bundling/scripts/createFixture`
1. Add an entry into the `bundling` CircleCI pipeline (`.circleci/config.yml`)
