Sure, here are seven open-source AI SDKs similar to OpenAI and Vercel:

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **OpenAI** | OpenAI provides a powerful platform for building AI models and applications⁴. |
| **Vercel AI SDK** | An open-source library for building AI-powered user interfaces¹. |
| **WunderGraph Agent SDK** | An open-source library that helps you to integrate OpenAI into your existing API infrastructure¹. |
| **Langfuse** | An open-source analytics for LLM apps¹. |
| **LangSmith** | A unified platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring LLM applications¹. |
| **Axflow** | A comprehensive end-to-end open-source LLM framework for TypeScript¹. |
| **ChatDev** | A framework for building communicative agents for software development¹. |

Sure, here are the types of Artificial Intelligence (AI) classified based on their likeness to the human mind and their functionality:

| Type of AI | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Reactive Machines | These are the most basic types of AI systems and they can neither form memories nor use past experiences to inform current decisions¹. |
| Limited Memory | These AI systems can use past experiences to inform future decisions. Some of the decision-making functions in self-driving cars have been designed this way¹. |
| Theory of Mind | This is a more advanced type of AI that has a deeper understanding of emotions, beliefs, and thoughts that affect human behavior¹. |
| Self-aware AI | These are AI systems that have their own consciousness and are self-aware. This type of AI does not currently exist¹. |

There are also other ways to classify AI:

| Type of AI | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) | This type of AI operates under a limited context, often as a simulation of human intelligence, and is focused on carrying out a narrow set of tasks⁴. |
| Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) | AGI can understand, learn, adapt, and implement knowledge in a range of tasks at the level of a human being⁴. |
| Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) | ASI surpasses human intelligence and ability. It is capable of extraordinary levels of cognitive processing and can perform tasks that are currently not feasible for humans⁴. |
